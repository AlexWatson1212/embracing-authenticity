# Start With a Song

Sometimes we donâ€™t know what weâ€™re feeling â€” we just know somethingâ€™s stirring underneath.

This page is here to help. Below are 10 core emotions, each paired with a powerful song.  
Let the music speak first. Then sit with the reflection.  
Thereâ€™s no right order. No pressure. Just start with the one that calls to you.
