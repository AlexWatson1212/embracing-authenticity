For a long time, I carried this fear:  
> “Maybe I want too much.”  
Too much depth. Too much honesty. Too much emotional safety. Too much presence.

I shrank parts of myself to avoid being "intense." I watered down my truth to be easier to digest. I lowered the volume of my needs—hoping someone would notice me without me having to speak.

But here’s what I’ve come to realise:

**What I wanted wasn’t too much.**  
It just wasn’t available in the places I kept searching.

And that’s not a flaw in me. It’s a misalignment.

Now I’m unlearning the belief that asking for what I truly need is a burden. I’m unlearning the reflex to apologise for longing. I’m unlearning the idea that needing depth means I’m too sensitive.

What I wanted was never too much.  
It just requires someone who knows how to meet it.

And while I wait, I’ve learned to meet myself that way too.
