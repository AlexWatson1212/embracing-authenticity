There’s a part of me that used to panic in the unknown.

If I didn’t have a plan, a label, or a clear next step—  
I felt like I was failing.  
Like I was falling behind.  
Like everyone else had it figured out but me.

But I’ve learned to slow that voice down.

**I don’t need to have all the answers.**

Not today. Not right now.

Sometimes clarity comes *after* I move.  
Sometimes it comes *while* I rest.  
Sometimes it doesn’t come at all—and I have to walk forward anyway.

The truth is:  
I’m not supposed to have it all mapped out.

I’m not a machine. I’m a man.  
A human being with seasons, doubts, and unfolding truths.

And the more I allow that, the freer I feel.

Life isn’t a test I need to ace.  
It’s something I get to live—*one uncertain, beautiful step at a time.*
