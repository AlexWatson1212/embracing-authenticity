Maybe part of me created this website as a last-ditch attempt to keep parenting, just in case I couldn't be here someday.  
A way to pass something down. To leave guidance. To try and protect my son from pain or confusion or loss.

But lately, I’ve started to realise — maybe that’s not the healthiest foundation.  
Maybe it’s not my job to *prepare him for everything* or to *give him answers in advance.*  
Maybe he doesn’t need me to map it all out.

Because although he’s vulnerable — he’s also *resilient*.  
He’s *capable*.  
He’s already proving that, every day.

And the truth is, he has so much more support than I ever did.  
He has me.  
Not perfectly. Not always knowing what to say.  
But *present*.  
Loving him. Holding space for him. Being there.

This website doesn’t need to be a lifeline.  
It can be a *light*.  
Something gentle. Something honest. Something he can return to when *he* chooses — not because he has to, but because he wants to.

Maybe the most loving thing I can do is *trust* him.  
To find his own way.  
To struggle sometimes, and still rise.  
To grow through life, not around it.

And maybe the most healing thing I can do for myself is to stop projecting my own childhood vulnerability onto him.  
Because he’s not me.  
He’s not alone like I was.  
He’s already more whole than I ever felt at his age.

I’m not planning to die any time soon.  
But if one day he visits this site, I want it to feel like an invitation — not instruction.  
A place where he can glimpse who I really was.  
Not a manual, but a mirror.

Not a lifeline,  
But a light.
