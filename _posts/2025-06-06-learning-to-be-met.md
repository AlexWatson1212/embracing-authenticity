I wasn’t used to it.

Someone looked at me—and stayed.  
They didn’t turn away when I said how I felt.  
They didn’t flinch when I named a fear.  
They just… listened.

And I almost ran.

### 💡 It’s Hard to Receive What You Never Had

When you’re used to being the giver, the listener, the holder—  
Letting someone meet you can feel threatening.

> “What if I’m too much?”  
> “What if they leave?”  
> “What if I trust this… and it disappears?”

But I stayed.

Not because it was easy.  
But because I knew this was the next step:  
**Letting someone *in*.**

### 🌱 It’s a Practice

Learning to be met isn’t about finding the “right” person.  
It’s about recognising when *you* are finally safe enough to stop hiding.

It’s not a spotlight.  
It’s a shared glow.

And it doesn’t mean I need to be vulnerable with everyone.

Just that I don’t abandon myself when someone sees me.

I meet them there.

I meet *me* there.
