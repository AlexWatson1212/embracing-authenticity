I used to believe that healing meant finally feeling okay.

That the goal was constant peace. Constant clarity. Constant strength.

But that belief became another burden—another standard I could never reach.

Because the truth is, **I’m not always okay.**

Some mornings I wake up flat. Some nights I feel anxious for no clear reason.  
Sometimes I doubt myself. Sometimes I feel low.  
And that doesn’t mean I’ve failed. It means I’m *alive*.

Being human comes with waves.

Healing isn’t about avoiding them—it’s about riding them with more grace, more compassion, and less fear.

I don’t need to fix every feeling.  
I don’t need to be at my best to be worthy of care.  
I don’t need to always feel okay to trust my path.

Some days are hard.  
Some days are quiet.  
Some days are just… days.

And all of them are welcome here.
