There’s a voice in me that still thinks I have to *earn* kindness.

That I need to have a productive day, regulate my emotions, say the right thing, or avoid the wrong move before I’m allowed to soften toward myself.

It sounds like:
> “You’ll feel better once you’ve fixed this.”  
> “You can rest after you’ve done something useful.”  
> “You don’t get compassion until you prove you’ve grown.”

But I’m slowly unlearning that.

I don’t need to perform worthiness.  
I don’t need to suffer enough to deserve comfort.  
I don’t need to be perfect to speak to myself with care.

Kindness isn’t a reward.  
It’s a starting point.

The more I offer it—especially when I feel like I don’t deserve it—the more I rebuild safety inside myself.

And that’s what changes everything.
