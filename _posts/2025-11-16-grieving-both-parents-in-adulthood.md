# Grieving Both Parents in Adulthood  
### Anger, Compassion & the Forgiveness I Never Received

For most of my life, I didn’t feel like I was allowed to be angry.

Anger felt dangerous.  
Disloyal.  
Ungrateful.  
A betrayal of the people who raised me.

But healing has shown me something I never expected:

**True forgiveness doesn’t come from bypassing anger —  
it comes from finally letting yourself feel it.**

Not to punish anyone.  
Not to rewrite history.  
But to reclaim yourself.

## **1. The Anger Toward My Dad**

I used to think:

“Why didn’t you protect me better?”  
“Why didn’t you stand up to her?”  
“Why did you let the house feel so unsafe?”  
“Why did you leave so early?”

And these questions still rise up sometimes.

But now I understand something deeper:

My dad couldn’t protect me because he couldn’t protect himself.  
He was cornered, emotionally broken, outmatched, unsupported, and slowly dismantled.

His anger wasn’t his nature.  
It was his only remaining outlet.

I can be angry at his behaviour  
*and* compassionate toward the man underneath it.

Both can coexist.

That’s true emotional adulthood.

## **2. The Anger Toward My Mum**

This one is sharper.  
Cleaner.  
More coherent.

I’m angry that:

- she triangulated me and my father  
- she used guilt as a leash  
- she reframed her own control as generosity  
- she positioned herself as the eternal victim  
- she created dependency and called it love  
- she never apologised for anything  
- she punished independence  
- she shaped the emotional climate of the house  
- she eroded my father  
- she shaped my attachment wounds  
- she taught me to feel responsible for her emotions  

This is not bitterness.  
This is clarity.

## **3. Compassion Doesn’t Erase Responsibility**

Seeing my mother clearly doesn’t mean I want revenge.  
It doesn’t mean she’s “evil.”  
It doesn’t mean I’m rewriting her into a villain.

It means this:

She never developed the emotional maturity needed to raise children safely.

She wasn’t equipped.

She didn’t grow.

She didn’t reflect.

She didn’t evolve.

And that is sad —  
but sadness doesn’t erase the impact.

Compassion helps me understand her,  
but it doesn’t require me to let her close enough to repeat the harm.

## **4. The Forgiveness I Never Received**

Neither of my parents ever apologised for:

- their projections  
- their mistakes  
- their emotional immaturity  
- the roles they forced me into  
- the guilt they passed down  
- the chaos they created  

They couldn’t.  
They didn’t know how.

My forgiveness has to come from **clarity**, not from being convinced their behaviour was acceptable.

Forgiveness, in my case, means:

- not carrying their wounds anymore  
- not reenacting their patterns  
- not living in the stories they created  
- breaking the cycle  
- letting myself live differently  
- protecting my son from what I lived through  

Forgiveness is not reconciliation.

It’s release.

## **5. The Child in Me Needed This**

The child version of me needed:

- safety  
- someone to say “this wasn’t your fault”  
- someone to hold my anger  
- someone to validate what I lived through  
- someone to tell me my perceptions were real  
- someone to honour my grief  
- someone to witness my story  

Writing these posts —  
putting them out in the world —  
isn’t oversharing.

It’s **reclaiming a narrative I was never allowed to speak.**

It’s making permanent something that was always hidden.

It’s giving my inner child a place in the world where his truth is finally seen,  
softly, quietly, and without apology.

## **How I Carry All This Now**

I carry:

- softness for my dad  
- boundaries with my mum  
- clarity about my childhood  
- compassion for myself  
- grief for everything lost  
- acceptance of what cannot be changed  
- anger that moves, not anger that festers  
- the desire to live differently  
- the commitment to parent my son with the emotional safety I never had  

This is what it means to grieve both parents:

Not to erase what happened,  
not to justify it,  
not to stay stuck in it —

but to finally see it clearly enough  
to step out of the story  
and into my own life.
