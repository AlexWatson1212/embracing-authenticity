There’s a strange tension I keep noticing.

I want to be seen.
But I still sometimes want to manage *how*.

Around new people, I feel this quiet urge to present the “right” version of myself —  
the version that will land well, be liked, be accepted.

Even though I know that’s not connection…  
it’s still my instinct.

## What I’m Noticing
The more I try to be seen the “right” way,  
the less I feel seen at all.

When I let myself show up slightly messy —  
a little uncertain, a little honest —  
I feel something loosen.

I feel *real*.

## Why I Think It Matters
I don’t want a life full of people  
who only know the version I carefully shape.

I want to trust that I can be met as I am —  
not as I perform.

---

## The Open Question
What would happen if I risked being seen  
before I know I’ll be understood?
