**I am learning that my discomfort in certain environments is not about race or culture — it is about belonging, social cues, and my need for a community that matches my nervous system.**

---

## The Shift

Today I realised something important about my relationship to where I live, who surrounds me, and what makes a place feel like “home.”

It is not skin colour, nationality, or demographic change that unsettles me.  
It is **behaviour** — especially when people do not offer the basic social cues that make me feel acknowledged, safe, and part of the fabric of a place.

A simple “hello,” a nod, or a glance is enough.  
When those cues disappear — regardless of who the person is — my system reads it as *potential exclusion*.

This isn’t racism.  
This is attachment, belonging, and the human fear of invisibility.

---

## Understanding the Real Fear

I named the underlying truth clearly:

- If the people who moved in said hello, the entire discomfort would disappear.  
- When people walk past without acknowledgment, it feels strange and disorienting.  
- I don’t thrive in environments where connection is absent.  
- My nervous system needs small, predictable, friendly interactions.  
- The fear is about losing **belonging**, not losing “Britishness.”

What surfaced wasn’t prejudice — it was the wound of early emotional invisibility  
meeting a changed social environment.

My body fears becoming the outsider on my own street.

This is not hatred.  
This is humanity.

## Learning From My Street

I’ve set boundaries with several neighbours, and the truth is:

- I over-engaged in the past.  
- I trusted too quickly.  
- I entered dynamics before I understood myself.  
- I tolerated things I wouldn’t now.

These relationships reflect the *younger version* of me, not who I am today.

I am the common denominator, yes —  
but I also wasn’t equipped with the self-regulation, boundaries, or discernment I have now.

It’s not the end of the world.  
It’s simply a mismatch that grew more obvious as I matured.

## What I Actually Want in a Home

Through this exploration, something clear emerged:

### **I want privacy without isolation.**

My ideal setup is:

- a **detached house**,  
- with **a bit of land**,  
- neighbours **nearby but not in my pocket**,  
- a sense of **familiarity** with people around me,  
- but freedom from unwanted closeness or intrusion.

I don’t want to be miles from civilisation —  
I want access to the gym, parks, and places where gentle human contact happens naturally.

This is self-knowledge, not avoidance.

---

## The Role of the Gym

The gym has become an important part of this clarity.

It gives me:

- predictable social norms  
- people doing the same activity  
- micro-moments of connection  
- belonging without pressure  
- a structured environment  
- shared purpose  
- sensory regulation  

I don’t need deep connection there —  
just presence, warmth, and a sense of being among others.

Even in a dream home, I’d still want some version of this “third place.”

It nourishes me in a very specific way.

---

## The Bigger Understanding

All of this points toward a deeper truth:

**I am discovering what environment my regulated, adult self thrives in — not the fearful or lonely self I used to operate from.**

This isn’t about rejecting others.  
It’s about choosing a life that matches the rhythm of my nervous system:

- space to breathe  
- people who acknowledge me  
- privacy I can control  
- access to gentle community  
- no forced closeness  
- no sense of being ignored or erased  

This is not intolerance.  
It is the beginning of authentic environmental design.

---

## Conclusion

I don’t want to escape my neighbours.  
I want to understand what *belonging* actually means to me.

Today helped me realise that:

- safety comes from social cues,  
- not demographic sameness,  
- my boundaries are clearer,  
- my needs are valid,  
- and I am allowed to design a life that supports my whole system.

This is not about race.  
This is not about nationalism.  
This is not about being intolerant.

This is about **connection, visibility, and choosing the kind of environment my adult self can flourish in**.

Now that I’ve said it plainly, I feel clearer, calmer, and more rooted in what I truly want.
