I’ve gone back and forth with this for a long time — wondering if watching porn is something that’s negatively affecting my life. It’s a question that sits right at the intersection of shame, intimacy, loneliness, and self-awareness.

And honestly? I don’t think it’s a problem.

Not for me, at least — not anymore.

### What It *Used* to Be

There were definitely times when I used porn as a kind of escape — from stress, from emptiness, from a lack of connection. And back then, I didn’t really question it. It was just a loop I dropped into without reflection. I can acknowledge that now, without judgement.

But something’s shifted. I don’t use it compulsively. I’m not stuck in it. I’m aware of the urge when it comes, and I can feel the emotional roots behind it. That’s already changed the dynamic.

### What It *Is* Now

Right now, porn feels more like a tool. A way to **accentuate my own pleasure**, to explore my body, to engage with desire in a safe and manageable way. I don’t use it multiple times a day. I’m not chasing more extreme content. I’m not losing hours of my life to it. 

And crucially: **I’m not using it to replace connection.** I’m just acknowledging a need that doesn’t yet have a long-term outlet.

Would I rather have a partner? Absolutely.

But I also know that seeking sex just for the sake of sex isn’t aligned with what I want either. I’m not looking to chase dopamine through meaningless encounters. I want intimacy. Mutuality. Presence.

Until then, sometimes porn fills a gap. And I’m okay with that.

### The Bigger Trap: Shame

If I label porn as a problem — if I let shame start running the show — that’s when things *do* start to spiral. That’s when I start hiding from myself, suppressing, controlling, white-knuckling it.

And ironically, that’s when the behaviour is most likely to return with more force.

If I just accept that sometimes I’m going to use it, that I’m a 34-year-old man with needs, that this is *a human thing*, not some dangerous compulsion... then the whole cycle softens. It becomes manageable. Almost boring, even.

It becomes something I *can* walk away from — when I’m ready.

### On Relationships and Real Women

I don’t feel like porn has made me more superficial. Actually, the opposite is true. I find myself more attracted to **real women** — especially women my age. I find artificial perfection boring. What draws me now is presence. Groundedness. Someone who can be with me, fully.

I don’t need flawless bodies. I need emotional intimacy. And the more I heal, the more I find myself drawn to that — not pixels.

I think that says something.

### What I’d Tell a Partner

If I had a partner who judged me harshly for occasionally watching porn, I’d want to be honest about it:

> *"I use it sometimes. Not because I prefer it to real intimacy, but because it’s safe, and it meets a need when connection isn’t available. I’d much rather be with you. But I don’t think this is something I need to be ashamed of — or punished for."*

That conversation, I think, is much healthier than hiding it or making myself wrong.

### The Truth Is…

Porn isn’t heroin. It’s not destroying my brain. It’s not stopping me from forming connections. What’s far more dangerous is suppressing my needs, denying my humanity, and internalizing shame.

This is a temporary stand-in for something I deeply long for: safe, mutual, embodied love.

And until that arrives, I’m going to be honest with myself about the fact that **this is what I’ve got** — and that it’s okay.

### Final Thought

Porn is not my destination.  
It’s a waystation I sometimes visit —  
with full awareness that it’s not home.

And I’m learning to be at peace with that.
