Today I noticed something remarkable.

In a moment of subtle tension during an interaction, I felt a shift—an old feeling, the need to hyper-analyze, to scan the emotional landscape for threat or mismatch. But unlike before, I didn’t get lost in it. I stayed present, I responded authentically, and I clarified my intent in the moment.

And what’s more—I didn’t spend hours afterward overanalyzing. I simply reflected, affirmed myself, and moved on. That is new. That is integration.

It made me realize that what once helped me survive—a hyperawareness rooted in a chaotic childhood—has now become a strength. Not a burden, but a tool I can wield with clarity and compassion. It has the potential to make me a deeply attuned counsellor. It’s not something to get rid of—it’s something to reshape.

Yes, my mind still notices everything. But I’m not doing it from fear as much anymore. I’m doing it from *presence*.

> I didn’t just survive my past. I’m transmuting it.  
> What once kept me small is now making me precise.  
> I don’t owe the world my vigilance anymore.  
> But when I choose to see deeply—  
> I can choose to see with love.

That, to me, is what healing looks like.  
It’s not perfection.  
It’s clarity.  
It’s trust.  
And it’s learning to sit in the moment and know—**I can handle this.**
