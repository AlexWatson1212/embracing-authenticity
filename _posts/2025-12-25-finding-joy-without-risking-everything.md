There’s something surprising I’m beginning to notice.

I always assumed that bigger tournaments would mean bigger meaning —  
more excitement,  
more recognition,  
more of that feeling of *“I’m good at this.”*

And yes… I *am* good at this.

I’ve made a significant amount of money from poker before.  
I withdrew it all.  
I’ve already proved to myself what I needed to prove.

Now… I’m starting from nothing again.

And I thought that would feel small.  
But it doesn’t.

## What I’m Noticing
I actually enjoy low stakes as much as higher ones.

I still feel the anticipation,  
the quiet fire when I go deep,  
the pride in making good decisions.

The game itself gives me joy — not the size of the buy-in.

There’s **no fear** attached.  
No pressure.  
No “this could affect my life” voice.

Just me, the cards, and the craft.

I love the journey of building up from zero —  
using only the free tickets or rewards the site gives me,  
turning that into something real,  
like a slow and satisfying climb.

It feels honest.  
Grounded.  
Mine.

## Why I Think It Matters
Poker is no longer something I lean on to change my life.

It’s something I can enjoy *alongside* everything else I’m building:  
my website,  
my writing,  
my life in general.

I don’t need to chase risk.  
I don’t need to prove anything anymore.

I get to enjoy the game I’m good at —  
without sacrificing my mental health,  
without gambling with my stability,  
without pretending excitement only counts if it’s expensive.

Low stakes give me everything that matters:

growth, challenge, flow,  
and the beautiful feeling of getting better at something I love.

## The Open Question
What if real success  
isn’t climbing the highest ladder…

…but loving the rung I’m on  
while I keep growing?
