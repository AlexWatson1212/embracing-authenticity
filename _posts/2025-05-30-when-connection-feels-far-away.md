excerpt: "There are seasons where closeness feels out of reach — not because you’re broken, but because you’re learning to belong to yourself first."

There are moments — sometimes long stretches — where connection feels like a distant thing.

You reach out, but it doesn’t land.  
You’re in a room, but still feel unseen.  
You’re craving closeness, but can’t quite find the thread that ties you to others.

And in those moments, it’s easy to wonder:  
*What’s wrong with me?*

But here’s the truth:

> Disconnection isn’t always a reflection of failure — sometimes, it’s part of the ebb and flow of being human.

We weren’t made to feel deeply connected all the time.  
Life has seasons. So does healing. So does intimacy.

Sometimes the world quiets down not to punish you — but to give you space to hear yourself again.

Sometimes the ache of loneliness is a doorway — an invitation to turn inward and ask:
- What parts of me am I avoiding?
- What kind of connection do I truly long for?
- Am I showing up as myself, or just someone I think they’ll accept?

You are not alone in your aloneness. Many of us are walking parallel paths — close in feeling, even if far in proximity.

And while real connection may feel far away right now, it doesn’t mean it’s gone. It means you’re in the in-between — the part where you reconnect with yourself so you’re ready when the right people arrive.

Stay soft. Stay open. Let the space do what it needs to.

**Even when connection feels far away — you are still worthy of it. And it will find you again.**
