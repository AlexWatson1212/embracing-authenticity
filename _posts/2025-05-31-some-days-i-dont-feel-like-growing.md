Some days, I don’t want to journal, breathe, reflect, or reframe.

I don’t want to process a trigger. I don’t want to find meaning in discomfort. I don’t want to make it a “growth moment.” I just want to be left alone, eat something comforting, and watch nonsense on YouTube.

For a while, I’d shame myself for that.  
> “You’re not doing the work.”  
> “You’re falling behind.”  
> “You’re wasting this time.”

But now I understand: those days *are* part of the work.

Sometimes the most healing thing I can do is let myself off the hook. Let myself be human. Let myself rest without spiritualising it.

Healing doesn’t mean forcing insight. It means giving myself permission to have soft, ordinary, messy days.

And on those days, doing nothing at all *is* the progress.

I’m learning to let that be enough.
