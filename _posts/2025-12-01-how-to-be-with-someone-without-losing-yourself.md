## How to Be With Someone Without Losing Yourself  
*A guide to staying whole, grounded, and authentic inside a relationship.*

Relationships can be beautiful, meaningful, transformative—but they can also be confusing.  
One of the hardest lessons in life is learning how to let someone in without abandoning yourself in the process.

Many people lose themselves in love:

- they merge completely  
- they absorb the other person’s needs  
- they minimise their boundaries  
- they silence their own voice  
- they become who they think their partner wants  

This might feel romantic at first, but it always leads to imbalance, resentment, and emotional disconnection.

Being with someone *should not cost you yourself.*

This guide is something I want my son to hold as a compass for every future relationship.

# **1. Know Yourself Before You Join Your Life With Someone Else**

If you don’t know who you are,  
you will use the relationship to define you.

Before you love someone deeply, ask:

- What do I value?  
- What do I enjoy?  
- What do I want for my life?  
- What are my non-negotiables?  
- What makes me feel alive?  
- What drains me?  

Relationships are healthiest when two *whole* people come together,  
not when two half-selves try to complete each other.

# **2. Don’t Trade Your Authenticity for Connection**

Love built on pretending is not love.

If you feel pressure to:

- be more impressive  
- be more agreeable  
- be less emotional  
- be less complicated  
- fit into their expectations  

…you will eventually lose yourself.

A relationship worth keeping lets you show your truth—  
not your performance.

---

# **3. Your Needs Matter Just as Much as Theirs**

In unhealthy dynamics, some people become:

- the giver  
- the absorber  
- the caretaker  
- the one who regulates everything  
- the emotional container  

While the other partner receives, takes, and depends on them.

This is not balance.

Your needs—  
for rest, space, reassurance, affection, boundaries, connection, solitude—  
are just as valid as anyone else’s.

A healthy relationship has **room for both people’s needs**.

# **4. Protect Your Inner World — Don’t Give It All Away at Once**

You don’t need to:

- overshare to feel close  
- reveal everything instantly  
- give your whole heart early  
- offer emotional labour before trust is established  

Healthy intimacy is gradual.

Let someone *earn* deeper layers of you through consistency,  
not chemistry alone.

You can be open without being unguarded.

# **5. Keep Your Life Outside the Relationship Alive**

A relationship should **add** to your life, not replace it.

Maintain:

- your hobbies  
- your friendships  
- your routines  
- your personal goals  
- your physical health  
- your emotional practices  
- your independence  

When you keep your world alive,  
you remain a whole person—  
not an accessory to someone else’s life.

This makes you more attractive, more grounded, and more fulfilled.

# **6. Don’t Confuse Intensity With Connection**

Intensity feels like:

- obsession  
- addiction  
- highs and lows  
- butterflies mixed with dread  
- emotional rollercoasters  
- fear-based attachment  
- overinvestment

But real connection feels like:

- steadiness  
- ease  
- curiosity  
- mutual interest  
- gentle unfolding  
- predictability  
- security  

Intensity burns fast.  
Connection lasts.

Choose the one that lets you stay yourself.

---

# **7. Set Boundaries Without Apology**

Boundaries are not walls.  
They are the structure that protects the relationship.

Examples:

- “I need time to myself tonight.”  
- “I’m not comfortable with that.”  
- “I don’t want to rush this.”  
- “I need honesty, even when it’s hard.”  
- “I won’t continue conversations that become disrespectful.”  

The right person will respect your boundaries.  
The wrong person will punish them.

Either way, the truth becomes clear.

---

# **8. Don’t Abandon Your Emotional Reality**

If something hurts—say it.  
If something feels off—address it.  
If something matters to you—express it.  
If a need arises—name it.

Losing yourself begins the moment you silence your truth to “keep the peace.”

Silence buys temporary harmony at the cost of long-term authenticity.

Speak gently.  
Speak clearly.  
Speak early.

---

# **9. Love Them Deeply — But Love Yourself First**

This is not selfishness.  
This is balance.

When you love yourself:

- you don’t tolerate disrespect  
- you don’t settle for inconsistency  
- you don’t collapse your identity  
- you don’t become addicted to their approval  
- you don’t mould yourself to keep their interest  

Self-love is the anchor  
that lets you love others without drowning.

---

# **10. The Guiding Principle:  
Stay Connected Without Losing Your Edges**

The healthiest relationships allow two people to merge  
**without dissolving.**

You remain:

- whole  
- distinct  
- curious  
- expressed  
- valued  
- grounded  
- alive in yourself  

When you stay fully you,  
you bring the best of yourself into the relationship.

And the person who truly loves you  
won’t want you any other way.

## Final Words (for my son)

Never lose yourself for love.  
Never shrink to fit someone else’s comfort.  
Never become smaller so they can feel bigger.  
Never carry a relationship alone.

Your presence, your needs, your values, your truth—  
all of it matters.

The right person will meet you where you are,  
grow alongside you,  
respect your individuality,  
and love you without asking you to disappear.

Be with someone who helps you become more of yourself,  
not less.

That’s real love.
