Sometimes I wonder if I’ve really grown.

Especially when I still feel triggered. Or low. Or uncertain. Especially when old thoughts creep in and I question whether anything has actually changed.

But then I notice the subtle things:

- I pause before reacting.  
- I take a breath instead of sending the message.  
- I listen to my body more.  
- I say no without guilt.  
- I come back to myself quicker than I used to.

And that’s how I know.

**Growth isn’t about never falling.**  
It’s about how I meet myself when I do.

It’s not always dramatic or visible.  
It’s often quiet, internal, invisible to everyone but me.

And that’s enough.  
I don’t need my growth to impress anyone.

I just need it to feel like truth in my body.

And it does.
