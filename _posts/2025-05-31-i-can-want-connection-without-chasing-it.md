There’s a delicate balance I’m learning:  
**Wanting connection without chasing it.**

Because I *do* want it.  
The late-night talks. The quiet companionship. The kind of love that feels safe and spacious.

But I no longer want to lose myself trying to *get* it.

I used to chase. I’d overextend. I’d prove I was worthy. I’d hope my effort would make someone stay. But what I’ve learned is—real connection doesn’t require convincing.

Now, I let my desire *be*.  
I don’t shut it down, and I don’t let it drive me.

I let it soften me, not spin me.

Because I trust that what’s right for me won’t need to be chased.  
It’ll arrive with reciprocity, not resistance.

And until then, I’ll keep tending to the connection I have with myself.

That’s the one that makes everything else possible.
