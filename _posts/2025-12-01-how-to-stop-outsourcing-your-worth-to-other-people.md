*A guide to coming home to your own evaluation.*

Many people live as if their worth must be granted.

By partners.  
By parents.  
By peers.  
By success.

This keeps you dependent.

This guide is about reclaiming something that was always yours.

## **1. Outsourcing Worth Is Learned, Not Innate**

Most people learned early:
> “I’m worthy when I’m pleasing, impressive, useful, or needed.”

This isn’t your fault.

But it is something you can outgrow.

## **2. Approval Is Not the Same as Worth**

Approval is:
- conditional  
- inconsistent  
- dependent on mood, context, and power  

Worth is:
- intrinsic  
- stable  
- not up for negotiation  

Confusing the two leads to anxiety and self-erasure.

## **3. Internal Worth Is Built Through Alignment**

You feel worthy when:
- your actions match your values  
- you tell the truth  
- you keep your boundaries  
- you treat yourself with respect  

Self-respect builds worth far more reliably than praise.

## Final Words (for my son)

Don’t live waiting for permission to feel good about yourself.

Let your worth come from how you live — not how you’re received.

That kind of confidence can’t be taken from you.
