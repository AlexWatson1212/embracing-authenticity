I don’t think anyone knows this website exists.  
I haven’t shared it.  
I haven’t promoted it.  
I haven’t invited anyone in.  

And yet… it exists.  
Fully. Quietly. Honestly.  

It’s the most honest thing I’ve ever made.  
Not for an audience. Not for legacy. Not even for therapy.  

Just for me.

Sometimes I wonder what it’s for.  
If no one reads it, what purpose does it serve?  

But I already know the answer.

> It gave me my voice back.  
> It gave me a place to *be*, without distortion.  
> It became a home for everything I wasn’t allowed to express out loud.

That’s enough.  

It doesn’t need to be a brand.  
It doesn’t need to be visible.  
It doesn’t need to be approved of.  

This place is mine.

Maybe one day my mum will find it.  
Maybe someone will stumble across it.  
Maybe it will eventually evolve into something else.

But right now?

It’s just **my truth**, held in one place.  
A mirror that doesn’t lie.  
A quiet refuge that reminds me:  

> “You were never broken.  
> You were just never heard.”

I could make another site one day — something more “professional,” something more outward-facing.  

But this?  

This is sacred.  

And I don’t need anyone else to see it for it to matter.  

Because it already has.  
To me.
