I used to avoid hard conversations.

Avoid saying how I really felt.  
Avoid setting boundaries.  
Avoid rocking the boat—just to keep the peace.

But the peace I was keeping?

**Wasn’t real.**

It was tension tucked under a polite smile.  
Discomfort I swallowed to protect other people’s feelings—at the cost of my own.

Now, I know better.

**Real peace includes truth.**

It includes honesty.  
It includes saying no.  
It includes walking away from what doesn’t feel good, even if it looks “fine” on the surface.

Peace isn’t about silence.

It’s about alignment.

And when I speak what’s real—with care, but also with clarity—I feel it.

That deeper peace.

The kind that doesn’t rely on pretending.

The kind that comes from standing in who I am.

Grounded. Honest. Free.
