There was a time I desperately wanted to be understood.

I’d explain my feelings in detail. Clarify my choices. Overcommunicate just to make sure someone *got it*. And when they didn’t, I’d feel small, unseen, even ashamed.

But the truth is—**not everyone will understand me.**  
Not everyone needs to. Not everyone’s meant to.

And that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.  
Or broken.  
Or too much.

It just means we’re living different stories.

Now, I give myself permission to walk away from conversations that only drain me. I save my deeper truths for those who’ve earned them. And I remind myself that *being misunderstood doesn’t mean I’ve failed.*

I’m not here to convince the world I make sense.

I’m here to live in a way that feels true—even if only I understand why.

That’s enough.
