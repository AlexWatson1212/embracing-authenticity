Lately, I’ve noticed how much effort I’ve put into trying to shape life —  
timelines, outcomes, the way things *should* go.

Even small moments can feel like they need managing:  
making the right impression, making the right choice,  
making sure I’m moving in the “right” direction.

It’s exhausting trying to steer what hasn’t happened yet.

## What I’m Noticing

There’s a gentler rhythm underneath all my plans —  
a way life seems to unfold *when I stop interfering*.

When I loosen my grip, something interesting happens:
- conversations feel more natural  
- anxiety quiets  
- I discover options I couldn’t have thought up  
- days feel less like tests and more like… days

It’s subtle.  
But I can feel my body soften when I stop insisting.

## Why It Matters to Me

I don’t want to live a life defined by managing risk.  
I want to live a life defined by being **here**.

I keep learning that control isn’t safety —  
presence is.

When I let things unfold, I notice:
- I’m more curious  
- I’m more open  
- I’m more myself

And that version of me  
makes better choices anyway.

## The Open Question

What might life show me  
if I stop trying to stay ahead of it?
