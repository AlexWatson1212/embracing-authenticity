There’s a difference between being alone — and feeling lonely.

For a long time, I didn’t know that.  
If the house was quiet, I felt restless.  
If no one was texting, I felt forgotten.  
If I wasn’t in a relationship, I felt like something was missing.

But now?

**Alone doesn’t scare me like it used to.**

In fact, I’ve come to love it.

There’s clarity in solitude.  
A kind of strength that builds when I learn to sit with myself.  
When I stop reaching for distractions and start listening inward.

It’s in these moments I hear myself the loudest.  
I create from a deeper place.  
I reconnect with what matters to me — not just what keeps me busy.

Loneliness still visits sometimes — and that’s okay.

But being alone?  
That’s where I’ve found some of my deepest peace.

It’s no longer something I run from.

It’s something I return to — with intention.
