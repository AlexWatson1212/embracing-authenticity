This morning, my legs feel tired. I’ve been moving a lot, and I can tell my body is asking for stillness. So I’m listening.

I’ve made my coffee, the sunlight is filtering through the curtains, and my dog is lying nearby — calm, grounded, and utterly present. There’s no rush, no list to conquer, no pressure to keep improving things. Just me, here, being.

I might read for a while on the sofa. Maybe later, take my dog for a longer walk and feel the quiet rhythm of the day. The weekend ahead will be full — being a single dad is beautiful and demanding — but right now, I’m giving myself permission to simply exist without agenda.

This morning, my heart feels full. I’ve shared a lot of myself with myself lately, and I feel good for it. Sometimes, the most productive thing we can do is to rest inside our own enoughness.
