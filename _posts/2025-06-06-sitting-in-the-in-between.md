I’ve left the roles that drained me.  
I’ve stopped chasing the love that never held me.  
But now I’m here… and it’s quiet.

This is the in-between.  
No longer who I was.  
Not yet who I’m becoming.

And it’s hard.  
Not because I want to go back—  
But because I don’t know what forward looks like yet.

### 🌫 This Isn’t Failure. It’s Fertile.

There’s a grief in this space.  
The kind that doesn’t come from loss, but from letting go without knowing what will take its place.

And yet—this is where something new can begin.

This is where I meet myself not as a role, but as a human.  
Where silence becomes soil.  
Where I stop performing, and start listening.

### 🕊 Learning to Stay

I used to fill these gaps with distraction.  
Or people. Or overworking. Or self-doubt disguised as productivity.

Now, I just sit.  
And breathe.  
And let the ache say what it needs to say.

> “I’m not lost.  
> I’m just *in between.*”

And that’s okay.
