For most of my life, I’ve carried this deep impulse to **explain myself**.  
To be precise.  
Clear.  
Impossible to misunderstand.

I always assumed this was a personality quirk — something built into me.  
Only now, at thirty-five, am I realising it was never a quirk at all.

It was survival.

Because the one person who should have seen me — my mother — spent my entire childhood twisting conversations, reframing reality, feigning confusion, and stepping around the truth whenever it suited her. And so I grew up trying to speak in ways she *couldn’t* distort. But she still did.

She didn’t misunderstand me.

She **refused** to see me.

This landed only in the past day, during the most ordinary moment: eating a lamb curry while checking emails. She had replied to a message I’d sent — a simple, clear message about finances and therapy — and she responded with guilt, money, confusion, and emotional accounting. The same tools she’s always used.

But something inside me was different this time.

I didn’t feel the old collapse.  
I didn’t feel the need to justify or clarify.  
I didn’t feel the urge to be understood.

I felt **done**.

Not done with her existence.  
Done with the *dynamic*.

Done explaining myself to anyone who benefits from misunderstanding me.  
Done being pulled into emotional loops I’ve already lived through a thousand times.  
Done shrinking into a version of myself that doesn’t exist anymore.

I went for a walk after that.  
Took the dog.  
Headed toward water, because something in my body needed space — a horizon, a place to let the charge move.

And as I walked, it struck me:

> *It wasn’t that she didn’t see me.  
> It was that she didn’t want to.*

For a child, that’s unbearable.  
For an adult, it’s clarifying.

Everything makes sense now — the way I always tried to say things perfectly, the way I feared being misunderstood, the way I kept hoping one day she’d finally hear me clearly, the way I twisted myself into transparency.

Of course I did.  
I grew up with someone who benefited from pretending not to understand.

Learning that is painful.  
But it’s also freeing.

Tonight I realised something else:  
I don’t need to explain myself to neighbours, tutors, family members, or anyone else.  
Not because I’m closed off — but because I’m finally rooted enough not to hand over my reality for someone else to interpret.

I am no longer the child who needed permission to exist.

I am the adult who owns his voice, his boundaries, his financial life, his choices, and his experience.

And for the first time, when I speak,  
**it feels like me**.

Not the child trying to be heard.  
Not the teenager trying to prove his reality.  
Not the adult trying to stay ahead of someone else’s distortions.

Just me.  
A grounded man who is finally waking up inside his own life.

The spell is broken.

And now I walk forward without explaining a single step.
