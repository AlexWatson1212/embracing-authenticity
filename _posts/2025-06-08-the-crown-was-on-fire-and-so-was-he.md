He told me about it like it had just happened.  
Even though decades had passed.  
Arthur Brown. Live.  
The fire crown.  
The theatre.  
The roar.

But it wasn’t just the performance that stayed with him.  
It was how it *spoke to something in him*.  
Something loud.  
Raw.  
Alive.

*“I am the god of hellfire…”*  

For most people, that’s just a wild lyric.  
But for my dad, it was a call — a challenge to the smallness he’d felt growing up.  
The emotional suppression.  
The pressure to conform.  
The rules, the expectations, the voices telling him to shrink himself.

And here was Arthur Brown — **flaming crown, screaming defiance** — showing there was another way to exist.  
Larger. Louder. **Unapologetically strange and seen.**

That show didn’t just entertain him.  
It *freed him*.  
It made him feel understood in a way that few things had.  
He wasn’t crazy.  
He wasn’t alone.  
He was just… built differently. And finally, that was okay.

I think we all have a moment like that, if we’re lucky.  
Where the outside world finally reflects the fire we’ve been carrying for years.  
For my dad, it was Arthur Brown.  
It was *“Fire.”*

---

Theatrical? Sure.  
Over-the-top? Absolutely.  
But it was also **truth in costume**.  
Truth set alight.  
Truth screaming back at a world that wanted silence.

I think that’s why my dad lit up when he talked about it.  
Because for the first time, *he* was lit up too.
