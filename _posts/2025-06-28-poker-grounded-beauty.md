I woke up today not feeling like a poker player. Not feeling like anything, really.

There was that familiar late-night regret — bloated, out of sync, the kind of night where old patterns creep back in. I didn’t act perfectly, but I didn't spiral either. That’s progress. That’s the real work. I don’t need to be perfect anymore. I just need to be someone I can trust again. That’s what this day became about.

I played solid poker from the very start of the day. Registered early. Took my time. There was a hand that might’ve been ever so slightly off — I shoved Ace-Jack offsuit with 13 BBs, five players left. On reflection, it was probably just outside the ICM line. Not a punt, but not ideal either. What mattered more than the hand itself was that I *knew*. I knew where the line was — and that self-awareness alone is worth money over time. That sharpness, that refinement — that’s what builds edges.

Even after losing that flip (Ace-Jack vs. Nines), I didn’t tilt. I re-entered another tournament and quietly built my stack. And then things started to turn.

I was short-stacked in another event, but patient. Slowly, I climbed. First to the final table, then up the payout ladder, and now... I’m in the top three. Already cashed for a strong return, and I’ve gathered the most bounties of anyone on the table. Then — a huge hand: I get it in with Jacks versus Queens on the final table. Button vs. cutoff. Nothing I could do there — it’s just a spot that plays itself.

But I hit a Jack.

It’s not luck that got me here. It’s the hours of patience, the folds, the discipline to trust myself when things looked rough. It’s the same quiet force I’m building in every area of my life. Even though I didn’t wake up in alignment, I ended the day in it.

This post is for my inner child — to say, *“Look. Even after a night of desperation, things can still go beautifully.”* Today became something quite extraordinary. I’ve already locked up strong profit, even without another hand being played.

The photos I took throughout the tournaments — from deep stacks to final tables — they’ll go here soon in a little slideshow. A visual story of the day I stayed grounded and showed up. Not for applause. Not to prove anything.

But to *show myself reality*.

That’s what this site is really about.
