*A guide to tenderness with discernment.*

Softness is often mistaken for weakness.

But true softness includes boundaries.

## **1. Softness Without Discernment Gets Hurt**

Being open doesn’t mean:
- ignoring red flags  
- tolerating disrespect  
- overriding intuition  

---

## **2. Strength Isn’t Hardness**

Hardness protects — but it also isolates.

The goal is:
> an open heart with a strong spine.

## Final Words (for my son)

Stay kind.  
Stay open.

Just don’t abandon your judgment to do it.
