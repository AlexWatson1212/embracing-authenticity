For a long time, I thought I had to choose.

Be soft, or be strong.  
Be kind, or be firm.  
Feel deeply, or stay protected.

But life has shown me that real strength includes softness.

**I can be both.**

I can feel everything — and still stay grounded.  
I can cry — and still show up for what matters.  
I can care deeply — and still set boundaries that protect my peace.

Being a man doesn’t mean hardening.  
It doesn’t mean hiding.  
It doesn’t mean silencing the parts of me that feel tender.

It means owning every part of who I am.  
The fire *and* the calm.  
The muscle *and* the heart.  
The protector *and* the poet.

Softness is not weakness.

It’s what makes me trustworthy.  
It’s what makes me human.

And I honour that more and more every day.
