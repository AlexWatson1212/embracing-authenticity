Disappointment used to derail me. I’d spiral, question everything, and try to force clarity. Now, I’m learning to simply *sit with it*. No fixing. No proving. Just letting it be a valid part of the human experience.

I noticed this recently when someone didn’t reply. It triggered that old story: “I’m not good enough.” But this time, I didn’t chase. I stayed with myself. And slowly, the shame passed.

Every time I do this, I grow.
