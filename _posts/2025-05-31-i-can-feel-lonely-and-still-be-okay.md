Sometimes I feel lonely.  
Even when life is going well. Even when I’m grounded. Even when I’ve done all the “right” things for myself.

The feeling comes in quietly. A little ache. A longing to be seen in a way that solitude can’t quite reach.

And for a while, I thought that meant something was wrong.  
That I wasn’t healed enough. That I hadn’t “mastered” being alone.

But now I know:  
**Feeling lonely doesn’t mean I’m broken.**

It just means I’m human — with a nervous system wired for connection.

I can sit with loneliness without turning it into shame.  
I can let it be a passing wave, not a verdict on my worth.  
I can feel it fully — and still trust myself to be okay.

Because loneliness isn’t something I need to erase.

It’s something I can hold, gently, until it softens.

And it always does.
