There’s no grand arrival.

No cinematic breakthrough.  
No dramatic embrace with music swelling in the background.

Just… stillness.

Warmth.

Presence.

### 🤝 This Is What Safety Feels Like

It’s the text that says “You don’t need to explain.”  
It’s the silence that isn’t awkward.  
It’s the feeling that your nervous system doesn’t have to brace anymore.

Being held isn’t about being rescued.  
It’s about being *witnessed*—and *not left*.

### 💛 What I Know Now

I used to think love had to be big.  
Loud. Intense. Proving itself at every turn.

Now I know it’s the opposite.

True love—true holding—feels simple.  
But it changes everything.

It says:  
> “You don’t have to hold it all alone anymore.”

And I believe it.
