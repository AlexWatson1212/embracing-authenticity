I used to think doing nothing was wasting time.

That I had to earn stillness by being productive first. That rest came *after* the work. That I needed to have something to show for the day.

But I’ve been learning something quieter—and truer:

**Doing nothing can be healing.**

When it’s intentional. When it’s soft. When it’s free from guilt.

Doing nothing lets my nervous system settle.  
It reminds me that I’m not a machine.  
It reconnects me with the part of me that exists beyond my to-do list.

It’s not laziness. It’s *listening.*

To the part of me that’s tired. The part that’s stretched thin. The part that doesn’t need to prove anything right now.

Sometimes the most profound act of self-care is to sit, breathe, and not strive for a single thing.

And to know that even in stillness—I’m enough.
