There’s a difference between being alone and feeling disconnected.

It took me a while to understand that.

## What I’m Noticing

Some evenings feel peaceful.
Others feel heavy.

The external circumstances can be identical.

The difference isn’t the room.
It’s the relationship I’m having with myself inside it.

When solitude feels chosen, it restores.
When it feels imposed, it drains.

## Why I Think It Matters

Learning to enjoy my own company has reduced the pressure I place on others.

Connection becomes something I welcome — not something I chase to escape discomfort.

That changes the tone of everything.
