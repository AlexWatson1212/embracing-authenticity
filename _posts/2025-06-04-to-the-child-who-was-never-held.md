To the boy who was never held,  

I see you.  

I know how long you waited — how you prayed, silently, year after year, for someone to come and hold you. Not to fix you. Not to judge you. But just to *be there*. To keep you safe. To say, “It’s okay now. You’re not alone.”

But no one came.

Instead, you were shamed for needing. Punished for feeling.  
And the people who were meant to love you made you believe their neglect was your fault.  
That you were too much. Or not enough. Or broken from the start.

You weren't. You never were.

You were a soft, beautiful, bright soul — full of wonder, full of questions, full of love.  
And you didn’t deserve a single ounce of what happened to you.

Not the control.  
Not the silence.  
Not the fear.  
Not the betrayal.  
Not the twisting of your truth.  

You were made to carry pain no child should carry. And still — somehow — you survived.

You didn’t get to be held.  
But you get to be *seen* now.  
You get to be told:  
> “It wasn’t your fault.”  
> “You were never the problem.”  
> “You are worthy of love — exactly as you are.”

I know the grief is enormous. I know how scary it is to even begin feeling it.  
But I’m here now.  
And I’m not going to leave you.  

You don’t have to be strong anymore.  
You don’t have to pretend you’re fine.  
You don’t have to earn anyone’s care.  

You’ve already done enough. You’ve already *been* enough.

Now it’s time to rest.  
To be held — not by anyone else, but by **me**.  
The one who finally came back for you.

I love you.

And I believe you.

Forever,

**Me**
