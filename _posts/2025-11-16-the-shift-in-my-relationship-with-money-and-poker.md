# The Shift in My Relationship With Money, Poker, and Adulthood  
### Understanding Risk, Stability, and What It Means to Finally Feel Emotionally Grounded

Something significant has shifted inside me.  
I can feel it in the way I think about money.  
I can feel it in the way I think about poker.  
I can feel it in the way I look at the future.

It’s not dramatic.  
It’s not chaotic.  
It’s not overwhelming.

It’s quiet.  
Grounded.  
Adult.

For the first time, my decisions are coming from a place of stability rather than emotional compensation.

## **1. My Relationship With Poker Has Changed**

Last year I made over £10,000 from poker.  
I was proud of that — and I *should* be.

But I now see that some of my behaviours around deposits, risk, and stakes weren’t just about poker.  
They were emotional:

- Poker felt like freedom.  
- Depositing felt like autonomy.  
- Taking shots felt like rebellion.  
- Spending winnings felt like escape from my mother’s financial shadow.  
- Winning felt like proof that I could support myself.  

Even when I was being careful, emotionally I was still operating from an old wound.

Now that those wounds are integrating, my thinking has shifted:

- I don’t want to deposit large amounts.  
- I don’t want to risk emotional damage with high stakes.  
- I want to build the bankroll from almost nothing.  
- I want to play lower stakes without ego.  
- I want poker to be craft, not coping.  
- I want risk to be calculated, not emotionally charged.  

This isn’t fear.  
This is adulthood.

## **2. Building a Bankroll From the Ground Up Feels Different Now**

In the past, starting small felt tedious or demotivating.  
Now it feels like discipline.  
A fresh start.  
A stronger foundation.  
A chance to play with clarity instead of emotional residue.

The truth is, I can build a bankroll from scratch.  
I know that.  
I’ve proven it before.

The difference now is that I want to build it safely, sustainably, and slowly — because that protects my emotional state, my finances, and my long-term freedom.

This is what responsible poker looks like:

- Small deposits (if needed).  
- Lots of volume at low stakes.  
- No pressure on results.  
- No attachment to status.  
- No ego around buy-ins.  
- No desperation.  

Just skill, patience, and self-regulation.

## **3. My Spending Was Emotional — and I Can See That Now**

I used to spend money a bit more freely.  
Not recklessly — but emotionally.

It soothed things:

- loneliness  
- anxiety  
- old wounds  
- the ache of not feeling supported growing up  

And, if I’m honest, it also felt like pushing back against my mother’s control.  
A small rebellion.  
A way of saying:

> “This is my money.  
I decide what to do with it.”

That’s understandable, given my history.

But something in me has released that impulse.  
I don’t need to spend to soothe.  
I don’t need to rebel to feel free.  
I don’t need emotional purchases to feel alive.

And because of that, spending feels less chaotic and more grounded.

I can be tighter with money — not from fear, but from clarity.

## **4. My ISAs Were Not a Mistake — They Were a Lifeboat**

For a moment, I wondered whether locking my money in fixed-term ISAs was foolish.

But now I realise:

They were one of the wisest decisions I’ve ever made.

- They give me stability during college.  
- They give me annual financial “lifeboats.”  
- They stop me from making impulsive decisions.  
- They ensure I have support while building my career.  
- They protect me from relying on my mother ever again.  
- They give me something to build toward each year.  
- They guarantee that I’ll always have runway for the future.  

I’ll finish college with £20,000 maturing.  
Financial breathing room.  
A safety net.  
A soft landing.

My adult self was already planning for my future, even when I didn’t fully see it.

Now I see it clearly.

## **5. The Emotional Shift Is the Real Story**

The numbers matter.  
The bankroll matters.  
The budgeting matters.

But the real transformation is this:

**I finally feel capable of grounding myself.**

This is what changed:

- I no longer feel the emotional pull to overspend.  
- I no longer feel the urge to escape through poker.  
- I no longer feel chaos in my financial decisions.  
- I no longer feel dependent on anyone else’s money.  
- I no longer feel unsteady or uncertain.  
- I no longer feel like a child trying to survive.  

This is the first time in my life where my finances feel attached to my values, not my wounds.

## **6. What Adulthood Actually Looks Like**

It isn’t about perfection.  
It isn’t about never making mistakes.

It’s about:

- evaluating decisions honestly  
- protecting your future self  
- living within realistic limits  
- making choices aligned with your values  
- choosing stable ground over excitement  
- understanding emotional triggers  
- creating structure instead of chaos  
- taking responsibility without guilt  
- allowing yourself to grow  

And I’m doing all of that now.

Not perfectly.  
But consistently.

## **7. The Future Feels Different Now**

For the first time, money feels:

- manageable  
- grounded  
- calm  
- intentional  
- connected to who I’m becoming  

Poker feels like:

- a craft  
- a discipline  
- a long-term project  
- a doorway to freedom  
- something I can build slowly  

And life feels like:

- something I can shape  
- something I can trust  
- something I can plan for  
- something I can grow into  
- something I can protect  

This shift isn’t temporary.  
It’s foundational.

I’ve been circling this truth for years —  
but now it’s landed.

And that changes everything.
