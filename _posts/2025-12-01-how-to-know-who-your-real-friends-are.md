*A reflection on belonging, safety, and who you feel like when you’re with someone.*

Friendship shapes us more than we often realise.

The people we spend time with influence:
- how safe we feel  
- how honest we are  
- how we see ourselves  
- what we tolerate  
- what we believe is normal  

But not every connection that lasts is meant to be carried forward.

Some people walk with us for a season.  
Some are familiar but no longer nourishing.  
Some belong to older versions of us.

Learning who your real friends are is less about judgment  
and more about noticing what helps you stay whole.

## **1. Notice Who You Feel Like When You’re With Them**

A gentle place to start is this question:

> **“Who do I become around this person?”**

With certain people, you may notice:
- ease in your body  
- natural speech  
- relaxed humour  
- emotional safety  
- a sense of being understood  

With others, you may feel:
- tense or guarded  
- quieter than usual  
- subtly on edge  
- like you’re managing their reactions  
- like you’re not fully yourself  

Friendship doesn’t require performance.  
It allows presence.

## **2. Pay Attention to How the Connection Feels Over Time**

Some connections feel fine in small doses  
but leave you drained afterward.

Others may not be dramatic or intense,  
yet leave you feeling steadier, clearer, or more grounded.

Ask yourself:
- Do I feel replenished or depleted afterward?  
- Do I feel more like myself, or less?  
- Do I feel seen, or merely tolerated?  

The body often tells the truth before the mind explains it.

## **3. Notice Whether There Is Mutual Care**

Real friendship doesn’t require perfect balance,  
but it does tend to feel mutual over time.

This shows up as:
- shared interest  
- reciprocal effort  
- remembering what matters  
- checking in without obligation  
- giving without keeping score  

If one person is always adapting, reaching, or holding the emotional weight,  
something is likely out of alignment.

Mutuality doesn’t feel heavy.  
It feels natural.

## **4. Observe How Truth Is Handled Between You**

Friendship isn’t about constant agreement.

It’s about whether honesty can exist without harm.

Healthy connections allow:
- gentle truth  
- curiosity rather than accusation  
- care alongside clarity  
- disagreement without withdrawal  

If you feel you must censor yourself to maintain closeness,  
the connection may be conditional.

Safety in friendship includes emotional honesty.

## **5. See How Boundaries Are Met**

Boundaries reveal a great deal.

When you say no, need space, or slow things down:
- Do they respect it?  
- Do they adjust without resentment?  
- Do they remain steady?  

People who value you will not punish you for taking care of yourself.

Friendship does not require self-erasure.

---

## **6. Notice Who Stays Present When Things Are Difficult**

Hard seasons tend to clarify relationships.

You may notice:
- who checks in quietly  
- who can sit without fixing  
- who doesn’t disappear when things are uncomfortable  

Presence matters more than perfect words.

And absence, while sometimes understandable,  
is still information.

---

## **7. Allow Relationships to Change Without Forcing Them**

As you grow, some friendships naturally change shape.

This doesn’t always mean something went wrong.

Sometimes it means:
- your values have shifted  
- your nervous system has changed  
- your capacity is different  
- your needs are clearer  

You don’t have to force closeness  
where alignment no longer exists.

Letting relationships evolve can be an act of respect —  
for them and for yourself.

---

## **8. The Guiding Orientation:  
Choose Connection That Allows You to Stay Whole**

The friendships worth keeping are not perfect.

They are simply the ones where:
- you don’t have to disappear  
- you don’t have to perform  
- you don’t have to earn belonging  
- you feel safe enough to be real  

Belonging isn’t loud.  
It’s recognisable.

## Final Reflection

You don’t need a large circle.  
You don’t need constant closeness.  
You don’t need to label people as “good” or “bad.”

You only need to notice:
- where you feel safe  
- where you feel respected  
- where you feel like yourself  

Friendship, at its best, feels like being met —  
not managed, not moulded, not tolerated.

Trust what allows you to remain present in your own life.

That’s usually where real connection lives.
