*A guide to quiet alignment.*

Many people don’t hate their lives — they just constantly escape them.

Through distraction.  
Through numbing.  
Through fantasy.

This guide is about building something you can stay inside.

## **1. Escape Is Often a Signal**

When you constantly want out, ask:
- “What feels misaligned?”
- “What am I tolerating that I shouldn’t?”
- “What needs adjusting — not escaping?”

---

## **2. Small Changes Matter More Than Big Reinventions**

A livable life is built through:
- rhythms  
- routines  
- boundaries  
- honest choices  

Not dramatic overhauls.

## Final Words (for my son)

Build a life you can wake up inside.

One that fits your nervous system.  
One that respects your limits.

That’s success.
