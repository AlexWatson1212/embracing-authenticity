description: A painful hand taught me something far more important than strategy: how to trust my gut, not just in poker, but in life.

I lost a hand tonight that felt… dirty.

I had a flush on a paired board. Got min-raised on the turn. My gut said, *"He's got it."* But my mind looked for patterns, made up reasons, tried to argue. He bet small on the river—*a good bet*, honestly, one that kept me in. And I called. And I lost.

Not just chips.  
What I lost was a little bit of trust in myself—because I already *knew*. My body *knew*. The line was strong. The spot was wrong. But I called anyway, because I didn’t want to be “too tight,” didn’t want to fold the best hand, didn’t want to miss value.

And now I sit here, not just reflecting on the hand—but the *lesson underneath it*.

Because what I realised is this:

> **My gut was right.**  
> And *that* is actually a more beautiful realisation than anything else.

The hand doesn’t matter anymore.  
What matters is that I’m learning—*slowly*—to trust the part of me that knows before I can explain it. The part that says, *“This feels off,”* even when the math or history says otherwise.

And it’s not just poker.  
This lesson is bleeding into my life.

I’ve spent years over-rationalising my way through emotional messes—trying to explain or intellectualise my way into safety. But it hasn’t worked. Because I’ve been guiding my feelings with my intellect, instead of letting my feelings lead and using my mind *after* to reflect and adjust.

That’s what I’m learning now:

- **Move with the gut. Reflect after.**  
- **Let your body speak first.**  
- **You don’t need to justify what you feel. Just feel it.**

This time, it cost me a cash.  
But maybe it bought me back a piece of self-trust.

And honestly? That’s worth more than any tournament.
