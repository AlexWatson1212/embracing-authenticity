*A guide to quiet character.*

Who you are alone matters more than who you are admired.

Integrity is built in private.

---

## **1. Self-Respect Is Built Through Small Choices**

What you do when no one is watching:
- how you speak  
- how you treat yourself  
- how you keep promises  

This shapes you.

---

## **2. You Live With Yourself Forever**

Public approval fades.

Self-respect stays.

---

## Final Words (for my son)

Become someone you can live with.

Everything else is secondary.
