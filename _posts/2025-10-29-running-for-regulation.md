# Running for Regulation

I went out tonight thinking I needed to be seen, but what I really needed was to be regulated.  

Sprinting gave me that. Not a slow jog, not a long run — just a fast kilometre under the clear night sky. It tired me out quickly, reset my nerves, and left me calmer. Jogging might help with cardio, but when it comes to emotional regulation, sprinting gets me there much faster.  

The truth is, it doesn’t take long. Ten or twenty minutes outside — even leaving my son in the house while I go — actually makes me a better dad when I come back. Because I’m calmer, more grounded, more myself.  

I think I’ve found a simple formula: **a hard sprint + a cold shower = reset**.  

It’s not about being the fittest runner. It’s about being able to return to my life regulated, present, and ready. Sometimes that’s all I need.

Would you like me to also add a little closing reflection line — like a compass point to remind you next time you feel the “bubble” rising?
