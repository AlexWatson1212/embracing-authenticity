description: I used to believe love meant being useful. But I’m learning now — my worth was never meant to come from what I gave.

I used to think being needed was the same as being loved.

So I became what people needed.

The caretaker.  
The peacekeeper.  
The listener.  
The one who always showed up — even when no one else did.

I shaped myself around the gaps in other people’s lives, thinking that if I could fill them, maybe I’d finally feel whole myself.

But what I didn’t realize then — and what I’m only just beginning to understand — is this:

> **Love that requires me to abandon myself isn’t love. It’s a survival role.**

---

For a long time, I thought that if I stopped being useful, I’d be forgotten.  
That if I stopped showing up for everyone else, no one would show up for me.

So I gave. And gave. And gave.

Until there was nothing left *of* me.

---

Leaving the roles behind doesn’t mean becoming selfish.  
It means becoming *whole*.

It means asking questions I used to avoid:

- What do I need?
- What does reciprocity feel like?
- What happens when I stop performing and start existing?

It means noticing when I’m about to say “yes” out of habit — and pausing instead.  
It means letting the silence stretch.  
It means walking away from relationships that only value me when I’m *useful*.

---

And yes, it’s lonely sometimes.

Because when you stop playing the role, some people disappear.

But I’m learning not to chase after those people anymore.  
Because if my presence depends on my usefulness, then I was never *really* seen to begin with.

---

So here’s where I am now:

> I’m no longer available for one-sided relationships.  
> I’m no longer interested in being the unpaid therapist.  
> I’m no longer building bridges that only I walk across.

This isn’t anger. It’s clarity.  
This isn’t bitterness. It’s healing.

And it’s the first step toward connection that’s *real* —  
where I am not a role, but a person.

Where I am not needed — but loved.
