For years, I’ve been slowly discovering that my inner world isn’t made up of just one voice, but many. At times I thought it was only my **inner child** crying out for attention. Other times it felt like chaos was overtaking me through compulsions or urges, and I blamed myself for being weak. What I’m learning now is that these experiences belong to different parts of me — parts that need listening to and weaving together.

### 👦 My Inner Child
He wants safety, nurture, and the freedom to play. When ignored, he collapses into shame or loneliness. When held, he reminds me of innocence and joy. With him, it’s about simple reassurances and small playful acts that tell him: *“You’re safe, I’m here.”*

### 🌊 My Inner Feminine
She is my anima, the part that brings intuition, creativity, sensuality, and connection. For years I projected her onto my ex — seeing freedom and playfulness outside myself rather than within me. When I don’t listen, she pushes through urges and compulsions. When I do listen, she whispers: *“Trust yourself. Dance. Play. Life is fun. You are not bad for wanting joy.”*

### 🛡️ My Inner Masculine
He holds the container. Without him, things fall apart. He offers structure, presence, and boundaries so that my child and feminine feel safe. My old therapist helped me strengthen this part of me — not to control, but to protect and give shape.

### 👑 The Adult Integrator
This is the part of me learning to be father to all the others. Each morning I can ask:  
- What does my child need?  
- What does my feminine need?  
- What does my masculine need?  

And then take one small action for each. Over time, trust grows, and the parts begin to work together rather than pulling me apart.

I’ve noticed how this mirrors fatherhood in my outer life. With Victor, I expand the container slowly, letting him be more free as he becomes ready. With my dog, I let her off the lead to run wild — but always within safety. That’s the same balance inside me: freedom with protection, chaos with containment, play with responsibility.

Maybe waking at 3am isn’t a problem to be solved but an invitation. A reminder from my inner family: *“We’re here. Listen to us.”*
