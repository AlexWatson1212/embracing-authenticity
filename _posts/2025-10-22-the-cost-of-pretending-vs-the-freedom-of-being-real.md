I came across this video today, and it really captures why *Embracing Authenticity* exists.  
It speaks to the price we pay when we pretend we’re okay — the slow erosion that comes from hiding our true feelings and wearing a mask.  

But it also highlights the benefits of being real: allowing ourselves to feel emotions, honouring what’s true inside, and showing up authentically with others.  
This is the heart of what I’m exploring here — the courage to let go of the false self and live from the real self.
