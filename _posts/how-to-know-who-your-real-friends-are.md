## How to Know Who Your Real Friends Are  
*A guide to recognising the people who truly belong in your life.*

Friendship is one of the most important parts of being human.  
The people you surround yourself with shape your values, your choices, your confidence, and even the direction your life takes.

But not everyone who spends time with you is a **friend**.  
Some people are companions.  
Some are conveniences.  
Some are temporary.  
Some are lessons.  

And a few—only a few—are real friends.

This guide explains how to recognise the difference.  
It’s something I want my son to understand, because choosing the right people protects your heart and strengthens your future.

# **1. A Real Friend Makes You Feel Like Yourself**

There’s a simple test for friendship:

> **“Who do I feel like when I’m with them?”**

With real friends, you feel:

- relaxed  
- safe  
- understood  
- seen  
- accepted  
- energised  

You don’t perform.  
You don’t shrink.  
You don’t edit yourself to fit in.

You feel like **you**.

Anyone who requires you to be smaller, quieter, tougher, funnier, or someone you’re not  
is not a friend—just an audience or a role.

---

# **2. Real Friends Are Present, Not Convenient**

Some people are only around when:

- they’re bored,  
- they need something,  
- or you’re easy company.

Real friends show up because the **connection matters**, not because you’re filling a gap in their day.

Presence is the currency of friendship.  
Convenience is the currency of acquaintances.

Know the difference.

# **3. Real Friends Want the Best for You**

Here’s the truth:

Not everyone wants you to grow.

Some people secretly prefer you:

- insecure,  
- dependent,  
- limited,  
- or predictable.

Real friends don’t feel threatened by your growth.  
They celebrate it.

They want you to:

- meet good people,  
- find meaningful love,  
- pursue your dreams,  
- overcome your fears,  
- and become the best version of yourself.

If someone feels competitive, resentful, or “off” when you succeed,  
they are not a friend, no matter how long you’ve known them.

---

# **4. Real Friends Tell You the Truth Without Wounding You**

A real friend:

- doesn’t judge you harshly,  
- doesn’t sugarcoat,  
- doesn’t avoid the truth,  
- doesn’t attack,  
- doesn’t gossip about you,  
- doesn’t shame you.

Instead, they offer truth with *care*.

They say:

- “I don’t think that person treats you well.”  
- “I’m worried you’re hurting yourself here.”  
- “I know you can do better.”  

Truth + compassion = friendship.  
Truth + cruelty = control.  
Avoidance + silence = distance.

---

# **5. Real Friends Respect Your Boundaries**

If someone becomes irritated, angry, or distant when you set a boundary,  
you’re witnessing the truth of the relationship.

A real friend understands:

- you need space  
- you need rest  
- you need time  
- you need honesty  
- you need protection of your energy  

And they don’t guilt you for it.

People who respect your boundaries respect *you*.

---

# **6. Real Friends Don’t Disappear in Your Hardest Moments**

When life breaks you open, you find out who belongs there.

Real friends will:

- check in,  
- sit with you,  
- listen,  
- support without fixing,  
- help you get back on your feet,  
- stay steady even when you’re struggling.

They don’t turn away because it’s uncomfortable.  
They don’t blame you for being human.

They stay.

That’s friendship.

---

# **7. Real Friends Grow *with* You, Not Apart From You**

As you grow:

- your values shift  
- your priorities change  
- your emotional world deepens  
- your boundaries strengthen  
- your life becomes clearer

Real friends adapt with you.

They don’t pull you back into old patterns.  
They don’t resist your evolution.  
They don’t make you feel guilty for changing.

They grow alongside you—  
or they cheer from where they stand.

---

# **8. Real Friendship Is Mutual Effort, Not One-Sided**

Ask yourself:

- Who reaches out first?  
- Who initiates plans?  
- Who remembers the things that matter to you?  
- Who checks in without being prompted?  
- Who invests emotionally?  

Friendship is not 50/50 all the time—life happens.  
But over the long term, the balance should feel **fair**.

If one person always gives and the other always takes,  
that is not friendship.

That is imbalance.

---

# **9. Real Friends Make Your Life Bigger, Not Smaller**

A real friend will expand your world.

They bring:

- inspiration  
- perspective  
- comfort  
- laughter  
- honesty  
- grounding  
- energy  

They help you become more of yourself, not less.

People who limit you, drain you, or weigh you down are not friends—they are emotional obligations.

Release them with compassion, but release them.

---

# **10. The Guiding Principle:  
Choose People Who Bring You Peace and Belonging**

Your real friends are the ones who:

- make you feel safe,  
- make you feel valued,  
- make you feel understood,  
- make you feel energised,  
- make you feel connected,  
- make you feel like your true self.

Friendship should not feel like work.  
It should feel like **recognition**.

## Final Words (for my son)

Friendship is one of the greatest joys of life.  
But only if you choose the right people.

Look for those who accept you without condition  
and challenge you without judgment.  

Look for those who show up, not just when it’s easy,  
but when it matters.

Hold close the people who bring you peace.  
Be the kind of friend you want to find.  
And remember:

A small circle of real friends  
is worth more than a lifetime of near connections.
