### The Hand

I was in an **APT Online 8.8 Double Chance** event — a format where you start with one 10k stack and can claim a second at any time, or automatically receive it if you bust. Near the money, I found myself with **18 big blinds in the small blind**, facing a **cutoff open** from a player with a roughly **20% VPIP** (though cutoff open ranges are naturally wider — closer to 28–32%).

I shoved **Ace-9 suited**.  
He tanked, then called with **Ace-Jack offsuit**.  
I lost.  

And as always, the pang of shame hit first — the reflexive thought: *you messed up again.*

But this time, I paused. I reflected.  
And the truth came through: I didn’t make a mistake.  
I just ran into the top of his range.

### The Logic Behind the Play

Here’s the technical side, grounded in GTO Wizard and ICMizer logic.

#### 📊 **Pre-Bubble Dynamics**
- Effective stack: **18 BB**
- CO opening range (approx. 28–32%):  
  All pairs 22+, all broadways (KTo+, QJo), suited aces, A8o+, suited connectors down to 65s.
- Hero (SB) shove range at 18bb GTO vs CO open:  
  **A2s+**, **A7o+**, **K9s+**, **KTo+**, **Q9s+**, **JTs**, **T9s**, all pairs 22+.

👉 **A9s is squarely in the profitable reshove range.**  
In chip-EV simulations, A9s shows **+0.35–0.45 BB** EV per shove versus a 30% CO open, assuming villain calls with roughly **9–10%** (77+, AJo+, ATs+, KQs).

Even accounting for mild ICM pressure near the money, it remains **+EV unless villain is calling ridiculously tight (<7%)**, which is rare.

#### 💻 **ICM Adjusted (ICMizer estimate)**
In a near-bubble situation (assuming 10% paid, 11 left, hero 8th in chips):
- Fold EV ≈ **1.00x stack value**
- Shove EV ≈ **1.03–1.05x stack value**  
(Still **positive ICM-EV**)

So, from both a **chip-EV** and **ICM-adjusted** standpoint, A9s remains a clear shove. The play wasn’t the problem — variance was.

### The Real Battle: Emotional Aftermath

After hands like this, my mind tends to loop the same message:
> “You fucked up. You’ve missed your chance again.”

But that voice isn’t coming from poker — it’s coming from **old wiring**. From the part of me that learned, long ago, that mistakes and losses mean *I’m bad*, not just *unlucky*.

What’s really happening is a **variance event**, and my body responds as if it’s **shame**.  
So I regulate. I reflect. I breathe through it.  
I write.

This is how I reset — consciously, manually. Maybe some people’s nervous systems just snap back into calm automatically. Mine needs this ritual — this meaning-making.  
And maybe that’s okay. Maybe that’s even beautiful.

### The Bigger Lesson

In poker, as in life:
- **Good decisions don’t guarantee good outcomes.**
- **Bad outcomes don’t mean bad decisions.**
- The real skill isn’t avoiding pain — it’s **returning to presence** after it hits.

So even though I lost this hand — I won something far more stable:
trust in my process, both logical and emotional.

If the same situation came up again, with the same information,
**I’d make the same play.**

Because it wasn’t a mistake.  
It was courage — executed correctly.
