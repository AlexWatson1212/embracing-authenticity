There was a time I spent too much energy explaining myself.

Why I thought the way I did.  
Why I needed space.  
Why I cared so deeply about things others brushed off.

I wanted to be understood — because I thought that meant I belonged.

But now I get it:

**I’m not here to be understood by everyone.**

Some people just won’t get me.  
They’ll misread my quiet.  
They’ll question my values.  
They’ll resist the depth I bring.

And that’s okay.

I’m not for everyone.  
And everyone’s not for me.

The ones who *do* understand?  
They feel like breath. Like ease. Like home.

They don’t need the full explanation.  
They feel my presence — and that’s enough.

So I’ll stop diluting myself just to be more palatable.

I’d rather be real than understood by the wrong people.

Because the right ones?

They’ll see me — and stay.
