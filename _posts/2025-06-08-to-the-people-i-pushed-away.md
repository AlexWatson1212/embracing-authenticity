To the people I pulled away from,  
went quiet on,  
distanced myself from â€” even though part of me wanted to be closer:

Iâ€™m sorry.

You didnâ€™t do anything wrong.  
You didnâ€™t scare me away.  
I just didnâ€™t know how to *stay* â€” not safely, not without shame.

### ðŸ§  I Was Afraid

Afraid of being seen.  
Afraid of being misunderstood.  
Afraid of hurting you with my own confusion.  
Afraid that if I got too close, Iâ€™d be rejected â€” again.

So I chose silence.  
Distance.  
Withdrawal.

Not because I didnâ€™t care.  
But because I *cared more than I knew how to handle.*

### ðŸ©¹ It Wasnâ€™t About You

It was about my past.  
My nervous system.  
My belief that love was earned, and that I could never quite earn it.

I projected all of that onto you.  
And then I ran.  
Or disappeared.  
Or became quiet and unreadable.

And for that, Iâ€™m sorry.

### ðŸ•¯ I See It Now

Iâ€™m learning how to stay.  
How to trust connection again.  
How to speak when Iâ€™m afraid instead of vanishing into silence.

Some of you might not even remember.  
Some of you might have felt confused or hurt.  
Some of you might have done the same.

But to anyone Iâ€™ve ever pushed away â€”  
Please know this:

> It wasnâ€™t because you werenâ€™t enough.  
> It was because I thought *I* wasnâ€™t.

Thank you for the space you gave me â€” even if it wasnâ€™t a choice.  
And if youâ€™re reading this nowâ€¦ thank you for still being here.
