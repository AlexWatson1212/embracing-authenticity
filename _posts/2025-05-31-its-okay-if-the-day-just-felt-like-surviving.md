Some days are heavy.

Not because anything major happened. But because I just didn’t have much in me. No spark. No momentum. Just… survival.

And for a long time, I’d beat myself up on those days:  
> “Why are you like this?”  
> “Everyone else is doing more.”  
> “You’re falling behind.”

But now I remind myself:  
**Getting through the day is enough.**

If I ate something.  
If I got outside, even briefly.  
If I stayed kind to myself when I wanted to give up—  
That’s not failure. That’s resilience.

There are days to thrive and days to endure.  
And both are valid. Both are part of the journey.

So when the day feels like too much, I don’t ask myself to be more.  
I ask: *How can I be gentle right now?*

That question is what carries me forward—one quiet, courageous moment at a time.
