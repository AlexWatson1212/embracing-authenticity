There’s been a noticeable shift in me lately — not dramatic, not euphoric, but steady.  
A quiet easing of anxiety that feels rooted rather than forced.

I think a big part of it is this:  
my long-term direction feels secure in a way that short-term uncertainty can’t really touch anymore.

My sense of purpose — particularly around counselling — isn’t something that can be taken away by delays, comparisons, or external outcomes. If anything, it’s becoming more apparent that this is not just *possible* for me, but something I can genuinely flourish within. That kind of clarity changes how pressure lands.

## Anxiety without collapse

Take placement, for example.

On the surface, I can feel anxious — the waiting, the comparing, noticing that others seem more forthright or intense, already locked into opportunities. But when I’m honest, the adult part of me sees the situation clearly:

I’ve only applied to one placement because it’s the only one I genuinely wanted.  
I might get it.  
If I don’t, it’s highly likely I’ll still find a placement or enough hours to progress.

The anxiety isn’t telling me something is wrong — it’s just old energy moving through a new structure.

Comparing myself to people who operate very differently doesn’t help anyone. It’s not a moral failing to be quieter, more selective, or less driven by urgency. It’s just a different way of moving through the world.

## Alone — but by choice

One of the biggest internal shifts has been realising that I’m alone right now *by choice*, not because I’m avoiding connection or failing at it.

I no longer tolerate relationships that aren’t reciprocal. Not out of bitterness or superiority — simply because I don’t see the point. If a connection consistently costs more than it gives, I’m willing to let it go.

There *is* a risk in this. I might filter out people who are somewhat reciprocal but not perfect. That’s real. But when I listen honestly to myself, I enjoy my own company deeply. And when that’s true, I’m not going to force connection just to feel less alone.

There *are* relationships slowly deepening — ones that feel mutual and alive — and I’m letting them unfold without pressure. That feels new, and it feels right.

## Not needing — without closing off

As an adult, I don’t really *need* anything in the way I once did. I can’t be abandoned in the same way anymore.

And yet, I still need human contact — just not desperately.  
Between my relationship with myself, my son, the connections I do have, and ongoing therapy, my needs feel more met than they ever have.

Therapy now feels like something I *choose* rather than rely on. I don’t attend because I’m falling apart — I attend because it continues to improve my life.

That distinction matters.

## Being seen — and mis-seen

I’m also aware of how I land with people now.

I notice moments of pity, discomfort, or misunderstanding. I can rub people up the wrong way when I’m being authentic. I may come across as arrogant or overly confident at times.

But what I recognise more clearly now is that this isn’t arrogance — it’s integration.

I’m no longer shrinking, explaining, or softening myself to manage other people’s reactions. That doesn’t always feel comfortable socially, but it does feel honest.

## Groundedness, not escape

There’s a quiet fear that sometimes surfaces — a worry about slipping into something ungrounded or unstable, given my history. But when I look at my life realistically, that fear doesn’t hold up.

I’m methodical. Balanced. Present.  
I don’t have coping mechanisms I’m ashamed of anymore.

What’s changed most is how I relate to coping itself.

I made a promise to myself: I can use a coping mechanism if I choose — but I still have to sit with the feeling underneath. No bypassing. No escape.

What’s happened naturally is that I now sit with the feeling *first*. It’s easier. More honest. There’s no real benefit in avoiding it anymore.

That feels like a quiet form of freedom.

## Coming into my own

I’m not claiming this will last forever. Life will change, stress will return in different forms, and I’ll meet new edges.

But right now, I feel more myself each day — not because everything is perfect, but because I trust myself to meet whatever comes next.

Not urgently.  
Not performatively.  
Just steadily.

And that, for me, feels like coming into my own.
