> *“Nobody wants him, he just stares at the world…”*  
> — Black Sabbath, *Iron Man*

This song hit differently when I heard it again as an adult.

Not just because of its iconic riff.  
Not just because it sounds like pain turned up loud.  
But because the story — of a man who tried to save the world and was punished for it — mirrored something inside me.

### The Wound of Being Misunderstood

The lyrics speak of someone who was *once human*,  
but is turned into something else.  
He becomes *iron* — cold, hardened, emotionless.

But here’s the thing:  
He didn’t start that way.  
He was changed *by what he saw*.  
By a world that didn’t believe in him. That rejected him. That feared his truth.

There’s a deep grief in being *misunderstood while trying to help*.  
It’s the kind of grief that slowly armours you.

That armour becomes your identity.

### A Symbol of Childhood Wounds

I think that’s why *Iron Man* resonates with me emotionally.  
It’s about someone becoming the thing they were accused of being —  
**not because it was who they were, but because of the way the world responded.**

I know what it feels like to be punished for the truth.  
To be seen as the villain when you were just a hurting child  
trying to survive in a world that made no sense.

Sometimes people fear what they don’t understand.  
Especially when it threatens the roles they’ve assigned to others.

### Becoming Iron

There were moments in childhood I felt *frozen*.  
Moments I went quiet.  
Moments I felt like **my very presence was wrong** — like something monstrous.

That’s what *Iron Man* captures:  
The disconnect between *intent* and *interpretation*.

He comes back to help.  
But he's feared.  
He’s cast out.  
He’s *iron* now.

And what’s left is *rage*.  
That deep, buried rage from never being truly seen or loved.

### But I’m Not Iron Anymore

The difference is — I’m not made of metal.  
Even when I feel cold, even when I disconnect — there’s warmth underneath.

And that warmth isn’t gone.  
It’s just *been waiting*.

That’s why this song doesn’t leave me stuck in pain — it shows me what happens when you *don’t process it*.  
When the world breaks you, and you get stuck in that shell.

I don’t want to live as Iron Man.  
But I honour the part of me that *needed* to be him to survive.

Because now I get to choose a different story.
