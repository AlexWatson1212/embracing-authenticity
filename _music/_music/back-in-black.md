There’s something raw and unapologetic about *Back in Black* that hits me in a way few songs do.

It’s not just the guitar riffs — although they carry a kind of confidence I longed for growing up.  
It’s not just the attitude — though it reminds me what it feels like to take up space in a world that tried to shrink me.

It’s the *defiance* in it.

The song isn’t really about grief — and yet, to me, it is.  
It’s about coming back from something. From loss. From pain. From being written off.

When I hear “Back in black, I hit the sack…”  
I think of every moment I got up again.  
Every time I stood in my own ashes and rebuilt something from scratch.

In some strange way, the track gives me permission to *exist loudly*. To not apologise for the pain I’ve been through or how it’s shaped me.  
It’s an anthem for reclaiming space. For saying: *I’m still here. And I’m not hiding anymore.*

It reminds me of the parts of myself that refused to be beaten down. The survivor in me that may have been silenced as a kid — but never gave up completely.

Maybe that’s why it resonates so deeply.
