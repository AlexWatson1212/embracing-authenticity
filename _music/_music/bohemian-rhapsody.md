Bohemian Rhapsody always felt like the story of my inner world—so many voices, so many moods, all crashing together.

When my dad used to sing this loudly, almost dramatically, it felt like he was expressing something too big for him to speak directly. Maybe it was the only time he allowed emotion out loud.

For me, it became a reflection of my own internal chaos. A part of my healing journey was learning to hear the pain inside the performance.
