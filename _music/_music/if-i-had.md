This song sounded like the noise in my head when I was barely getting by.  
The resentment, the exhaustion, the endless grind of life when you feel like you're doing everything and getting nowhere.

*If I Had* is Eminem before the fame—before the Slim Shady mask fully formed. It’s the unfiltered scream of someone who’s not trying to impress anyone anymore, just trying to survive.

It reminded me of the parts of myself that still carry that same pressure. That same desperation to break free. That raw honesty before it gets polished by performance.
