This song didn’t just speak to me—it *spoke for me*.
The words echoed things I couldn’t admit. About my mum. About my pain. About needing to let it out just to survive.

There’s something about music that bypasses logic and goes straight to the wound. And this song? It found mine.

Even in psychosis, I came back to it. Not because I was unwell. But because it held the truth too big to speak.

Maybe it will speak to you, too.
