There's something about *Take Me Home, Country Roads* that hits a nerve — not the kind that brings pain, but the kind that carries a deep, aching longing.

It's not about West Virginia for me.  
It's about *home*.  
Not a place — but a *feeling*.

> "Country roads, take me home / To the place I belong..."

I’ve never really felt like I belonged anywhere — not in my family, not in the world.  
But this song evokes something that I think I’ve always carried deep inside:  
a vision of a place where I’d feel understood, safe, and gently held.

It’s not about the geography.  
It’s about the heart.

There’s a tenderness in Denver’s voice that feels like what I wish I’d grown up with.  
Something soft.  
Something reliable.  
Something that didn’t demand I change who I was to be loved.

> "Driving down the road I get a feeling / That I should have been home yesterday..."

That line? That’s the part that stings.  
Because I *should* have felt home somewhere long before now.

And yet, maybe the song doesn’t just speak to loss.  
Maybe it points to hope — that *home* might still be something I can build,  
within myself,  
with others,  
with my son.

Maybe that feeling of being “taken home” is just starting to unfold now.
