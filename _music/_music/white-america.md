This track doesn’t hold back.

It challenged me to see how society selectively silences or amplifies voices—and how pain is often ignored until it comes from someone 'acceptable.'

It made me confront privilege, censorship, and the weaponisation of identity.

Uncomfortable? Yes. Necessary? Also yes.
