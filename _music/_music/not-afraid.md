This felt like a hand outstretched.

Like someone saying, “I know it’s hard, but we can face this together.”

It reminded me that courage isn’t confidence—it’s choosing to move *despite* fear.

This song became a kind of anthem for my recovery. A song I could stand inside when I didn’t believe in myself yet.
