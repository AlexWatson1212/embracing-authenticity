Mockingbird hits me hard as a dad.  
It’s the pain of not being able to give your child the perfect world—and still wanting to show up, imperfect but full of love.

When I hear this song, I don’t just hear Eminem’s story. I hear my own.  
It reminds me of the bond I have with my son, and the promises I silently make every day to never leave him emotionally stranded the way I once was.
