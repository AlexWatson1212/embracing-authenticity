When I first heard *Mockingbird*, I didn’t know what to feel.  
I just knew it was honest.

This alternate reflection is less about what I felt in the moment—and more about what I still carry.

This song taught me that even the strongest of us want to be held, sometimes by the very people we’re trying to protect.
