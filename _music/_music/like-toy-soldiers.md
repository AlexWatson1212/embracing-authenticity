This one felt like him stepping back and finally looking at the damage.

It made me wonder how often I’ve been dragged into battles that weren’t mine.  
How often I’ve hurt myself trying to prove I’m not to be messed with.

It’s a song that says: *I’m tired*. And sometimes, that’s the bravest thing to admit.
