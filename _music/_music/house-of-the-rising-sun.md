There’s something in *The House of the Rising Sun* that doesn’t just play — it howls.

It’s not just the melody. It’s the feeling that something old, something unspoken, is rising with the dawn. A cry from the past that still lingers in the bones. A song of regret that feels too familiar.

When I hear it, I hear more than just a man telling a story of ruin.  
I hear *generations whispering through the cracks in the walls.*  
The weight of choices made before I was born.  
The ache of being born into something I didn’t choose.

The “howls” are not just the vocals — they’re the echoes of a family that couldn’t hold each other, the silent screams of children growing up too fast, too unseen. And in some strange way, they’re *my* howls too.

Maybe that's what makes music powerful.  
It becomes a mirror.  
A place where the soul can leak out in verse and distortion.  
A space where the pain doesn’t need to be explained, just felt.

This song isn’t just about a house in New Orleans.  
It’s about *every house* that swallowed the light and left a ghost behind.

Let the sun rise.  
Let the howls come.  
Maybe this time, I’ll listen all the way through.
