> *“I’m gonna fight ‘em off / A seven nation army couldn’t hold me back.”*  
> — The White Stripes, *Seven Nation Army*

This isn’t just an anthem.  
It’s a mantra.

It plays like a war drum —  
Steady. Relentless.  
Marching forward even when you’re tired.

And maybe that’s why it connects with something deep in me.

### The Invisible War

The war I’ve been fighting hasn’t been external.  
Not really.  
It’s been the slow, quiet kind of battle —  
The kind where your enemy wears your own face.

It’s the kind of war you fight when you’re trying to hold onto your identity  
while the world — or your past — tries to strip it from you.

### The Need to Be Heard

There’s something primal in that riff.  
It’s not just music.  
It’s a declaration.

It feels like what I’ve wanted to scream so many times:  
**I won’t disappear.**  
No matter what’s been done.  
No matter how many voices try to rewrite my story.

This song doesn't whisper — it *dares* to be loud.  
Even when no one is listening.  
Especially then.

### The Haunting Line: “And the message coming from my eyes says, ‘Leave it alone.’”

It’s like that moment when you're trying to hold yourself together,  
and someone looks too closely.

You don’t want to talk.  
You don’t want to explain.  
You just want to *feel* it. Alone. Without being dissected.

It’s grief and fury and protection all wrapped into one line.

### The Part of Me That Fights

There’s a version of me — scarred, quiet, but determined —  
that rises up when I hear this track.

The one that’s stood up after being knocked down,  
not because I wanted to, but because there was no other choice.

The one that learned to survive —  
not with grace, but with grit.

Seven Nation Army doesn’t glorify the fight.  
It *names* it.  
And gives it rhythm.  
And in doing so, gives it a kind of dignity.

### I’m Still Marching

I’m not done with the war inside.  
But I’m not losing either.

Each step forward is a beat in the song.  
Each breath I take that says, “I’m still here” —  
is its own kind of victory.
