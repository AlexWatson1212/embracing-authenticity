This wasn’t just hype. It was *urgency*.  
The reminder that everything I want is already within me—but only if I show up when it matters.

It’s also a reflection of my fear: what if I miss my moment? What if my hesitation costs me everything?

But this song doesn’t give space for doubt.  
It dares me to believe I’m ready—even when I feel I’m not.
