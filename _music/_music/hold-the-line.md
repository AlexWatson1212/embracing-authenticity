There’s something in the opening chords of *Hold the Line* that grabs you — bold, urgent, unapologetic.

> “Love isn’t always on time…”

That line hits a nerve.  
Because it reminds me of how love in my life often showed up late.  
Or in the wrong way.  
Or not at all.

It wasn’t dependable. It wasn’t stable.  
But this song reminds me of the importance of *holding the line* — not just with others, but with myself.

It’s not about waiting passively.  
It’s about knowing your worth.  
Knowing what love should feel like — even if you’ve never had it modeled well.

The song is full of passion, but also frustration.  
It mirrors the experience of loving someone who can’t show up for you — and trying to stay anchored anyway.

It’s the voice inside that says:

> *Don’t lose yourself for someone else’s chaos.*

It’s a reminder to trust timing.  
To hold your boundary.  
To know that love should *meet you*, not just visit you when it’s convenient.

That’s why this song resonates.

Because I’ve held the line.  
Even when it hurt.  
Even when I didn’t know what was on the other side.

And I’m learning that’s a form of love too —  
Love for myself.
