description: "A full reflection on the songs by Eminem that mirrored my pain, fatherhood, rage, and survival."

Eminemâ€™s music wasnâ€™t background noiseâ€”it was *a lifeline*.  
It spoke to the parts of me I didnâ€™t know how to put into words.  
The rage, the grief, the fatherhood fears, the identity crisis, the survival instinctâ€”itâ€™s all in there.

### ðŸŽ¤ Songs Reflected On:
- [Cleaning Out My Closet](/music-therapy/cleaning-out-my-closet) â€” the song that said what I never dared to
- [Mockingbird](/music-therapy/mockingbird) â€” my bond with my son, mirrored in one of his rawest tracks
- [If I Had](/music-therapy/if-i-had) â€” the pressure-cooker cry of being stuck and unseen
- [No Apologies](/music-therapy/no-apologies) â€” the declaration that I donâ€™t owe the world a version of me they approve of

Each track did something different:
- **One held my grief**  
- **One made space for my anger**  
- **One gave me the courage to fight for my son**  
- **One gave me permission to stop apologising**

Eminem became something like an emotional father figureâ€”not perfect, but *real*.  
He didnâ€™t pretend it was okay. He just told the truth loud enough that my own truth came loose.

This collection isnâ€™t about idolising. Itâ€™s about recognising that sometimes, music says what we canâ€™tâ€”and thatâ€™s where the healing begins.
