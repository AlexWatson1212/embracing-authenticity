There’s something hypnotic and haunting about *Sweet Dreams*.  
It’s a song that’s often danced to — but to me, it’s drenched in pain and truth.

> "Sweet dreams are made of this / Who am I to disagree?"

That line lands like a sigh from someone who’s been dragged through life’s contradictions — who’s learned not to trust what others say about dreams, or success, or belonging.

There’s resignation in those lyrics.  
But there’s defiance too.

The beat keeps pulsing — like the will to survive.

> "Some of them want to use you / Some of them want to get used by you..."

It reminds me of relationships where I wasn’t fully seen.  
Where I became a role, a mirror, or a vessel — never quite myself.  
And maybe I did the same to others without knowing.

It’s a track about masks and power, about longing for meaning in a world where so many connections feel transactional.

But even with that — it *moves*.  
It doesn’t stay stuck.  
It *drives forward*, just like I have.

And that’s why it hits me.

Because even when you’re disillusioned...  
Even when you don’t trust the world or yourself...  
Something inside keeps you walking, searching, pulsing forward — like that beat.

Maybe *Sweet Dreams* is what survival sounds like when it still dares to hope.
