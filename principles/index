    These are not rules.  
    They are not instructions.  
    They are not meant to be copied or followed.

  <p>
    They are the orientation I return to when life becomes unclear —  
    a way of standing that values steadiness, honesty, and self-respect  
    over performance, optimisation, or certainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    If something here resonates, let it prompt reflection.  
    If it doesn’t, leave it.

  <h2>1. Self-Trust & Inner Authority</h2>

  <p>
    Learning to trust your own perception, evaluation, and timing —  
    without outsourcing worth, clarity, or direction to other people.

  <h2>2. Boundaries, Responsibility & Integrity</h2>

  <p>
    Holding boundaries without hardening,  
    taking responsibility without self-blame,  
    and carrying influence or power without losing yourself.

  <h2>3. Emotion & Regulation</h2>

  <p>
    Learning to feel deeply without collapsing,  
    to recover from shame without disappearing,  
    and to repair relationships without self-destruction.

  <h2>4. Uncertainty, Limits & Reality</h2>

  <p>
    Accepting that not everything will resolve cleanly,  
    that life includes limits and loss,  
    and that some chapters will never make full sense.

  <h2>5. Connection Without Self-Erasure</h2>

  <p>
    Learning how to be alone without becoming isolated,  
    how to stay open without becoming naïve,  
    and how to walk away when staying costs self-respect.
  </p>

  <p>
    These principles are not a destination.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are a way of staying oriented  
    when certainty falls away,  
    when roles dissolve,  
    and when the temptation to abandon yourself is strongest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adulthood, as I understand it,  
    is not about having answers —  
    but about remaining grounded, honest, and intact  
    while living inside the questions.
