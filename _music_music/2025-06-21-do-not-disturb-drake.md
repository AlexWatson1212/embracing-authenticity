*Do Not Disturb* isn’t flashy.  
It’s not a hit you throw on to hype yourself up.  
It’s a reflection — the kind that only comes in the early hours,  
when you’ve been grinding for so long that even your victories feel quiet.

This one hits me because it mirrors something I’ve lived.

When you’re building something — a dream, a craft, a life that no one really understands —  
there’s this feeling of being alone at the top of a mountain you had to climb by yourself.  
Drake’s tone in this track? That’s solitude. That’s sacrifice.  
That’s someone who's finally making it — but still carrying all the weight from when they weren’t.

It reminds me of the late nights I spent building my poker game,  
sharpening my skills while people thought I was just “messing around.”  
There’s something maddening and magical about knowing you're doing something important —  
and no one else sees it until the results are undeniable.

That’s what this song gives me:  
A sense of self-trust, even in isolation.  
A reminder that some things are built in silence,  
in the in-between spaces where the crowd doesn’t cheer.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What have you built in silence — and what would it mean to fully honour the version of you who kept going, even when no one was watching?*
