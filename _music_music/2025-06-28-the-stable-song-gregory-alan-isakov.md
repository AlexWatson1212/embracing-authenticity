*The Stable Song* feels like standing still in the middle of a storm.  
It’s not loud. It doesn’t demand.  
It just… aches — in the most beautiful way.

There’s something about Gregory Alan Isakov’s voice —  
like a ghost passing through the room, gently brushing your skin.  
It’s the sound of trying to remember who you are  
while the world keeps changing around you.

This song feels like it was written by someone who has lost and found themselves —  
and then lost themselves again.  
It’s a hymn for the parts of us that don’t quite fit,  
the moments we look around and quietly ask, *“Is this really my life?”*

Lines like *“I’ve been crazy, couldn’t you tell?”*  
don’t feel dramatic — they feel honest.  
Not a performance — just a whisper of truth.

I often return to this song when I’m in that liminal space —  
not broken, not whole, just… human.  
It reminds me that it’s okay to wander.  
It’s okay not to have answers.  
It’s okay to long for something we can’t quite name.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*Where in your life do you feel like you’re standing still — not because you’re lost, but because something in you is quietly listening?*
