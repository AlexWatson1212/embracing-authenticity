There’s no pretending with this one.

*When I Grow Up* by NF is full of rage, hunger, and an almost painful sense of refusal —  
refusal to be ignored, belittled, or forgotten.

It taps into the energy that rises when the world writes you off —  
and you decide to prove them wrong, no matter what it takes.

When I was coming up in poker, this song hit different.  
No one really understood how difficult it was —  
or how well I was actually doing.  
It wasn’t just about cards or money — it was about building something out of nothing.  
It was about discipline, strategy, grit — and yet I wasn’t taken seriously.

This song gave me that defiance.  
That quiet *“Watch me.”*  
It was maybe the first time I felt like I had power in myself —  
real power, backed by real results.  
And I didn’t need anyone else’s validation to prove it.

But underneath all the sharp lyrics and hard beats,  
there’s something even more vulnerable:  
a younger version of yourself who just wanted to be seen.

This isn’t just about making it big.  
It’s about reclaiming something.  
The power to define yourself — not by what others expect, but by what you know you’re capable of.

There’s a line between defiance and desperation in this track.  
And I think that’s why it lands so hard.  
You can hear the wounds behind the bars.  
And that makes the fight real.

Because it’s not just a song.  
It’s a declaration:  
*I’m not done.*  
*I never was.*

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What part of your past self still wants to be seen — and if you could hand them a mic for three minutes, what would they say?*
