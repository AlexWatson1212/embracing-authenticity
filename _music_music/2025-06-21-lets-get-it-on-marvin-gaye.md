Some songs stay with you because of their beat.  
Some because of the moment they played.  
And some… because they say the thing you’ve always wanted to say — or hear.

*Let’s Get It On* hits something deeper for me.  
Yes, it’s sexual — but it’s also soulful.  
It carries this tender confidence — like someone saying,  
“I want you. I feel this. And I’m not ashamed of it.”

There’s something powerful in that kind of permission.

I think, for me, it taps into the longing to be met in that space —  
not just physically, but emotionally.  
To be wanted without games.  
To feel someone’s presence without second-guessing.  
To drop the fear and just connect — not perform.

It’s not about lust. It’s about openness.  
It’s about two people saying, “Let’s stop holding back.”

And in a world where so many interactions are filtered, hesitant, or filled with fear of being too much —  
this song feels like a full-body yes.  
A reclamation of desire as something soft and sacred, not shameful.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What part of you is still waiting for that kind of unashamed closeness — and what would it take to let yourself be that open with someone else?*
