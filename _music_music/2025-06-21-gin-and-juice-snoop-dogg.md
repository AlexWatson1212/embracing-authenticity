With so much drama in the L-B-C…  
It’s iconic. Smooth. Effortless.  
But beneath that hazy vibe and laid-back confidence, *Gin and Juice* carries something else too.

For me, it represents escape.

Not just through drink or weed or parties —  
but from a world that asks too much and offers too little.  
It’s a soundtrack for when you just want to let go of control,  
to forget the weight for a night and live like it doesn’t matter.

There’s bravado here, sure —  
but there’s also grief underneath it.

The kind of grief that makes you puff your chest out  
because you don’t want anyone to see how exhausted you are.  
The kind of longing that’s hidden inside every “I don’t give a f***”  
because actually, you do — you just can’t afford to show it.

This song isn’t about glorifying that life.  
It’s about recognising the need for relief.  
The need to feel untouchable — even for three minutes and thirty-two seconds.

And sometimes, especially when life’s been rough,  
just having a moment like that —  
a moment where you feel cool, in control, free —  
can feel like salvation.

*When you imagine the version of you who “has their mind on their money and their money on their mind,” what’s that version of you really trying to protect?*
