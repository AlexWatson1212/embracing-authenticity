      <h1>Rewriting My Origin Story</h1>

        <p class="post-description">A raw reflection on psychosis, fantasy, and how my mind tried to protect me from the truth of abandonment.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>When I reflect back on when I went manic, I think it was a steady, progressive realization of the lack of connection and the depth of my emptiness — despite being surrounded by people who were supposed to be my friends.</p>

<p>They didn’t respect me.<br />
They didn’t truly connect with me.</p>

<p>And the more I realized that, the more weed I smoked. I progressively became more manic — until eventually, I entered psychosis.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-illusion-that-kept-me-safe">The Illusion That Kept Me Safe</h3>

<p>It started with realizing my family never really saw me.<br />
That their love came with conditions — with expectations that I’d be someone else entirely.</p>

<p>I think my mind, desperate to cope, constructed a story where I was someone <em>important</em>.<br />
Someone <em>chosen</em>.<br />
Someone whose pain <em>meant something</em>.</p>

<p>In psychosis, I remember believing I had a spiritual purpose.<br />
That I was on a mission.<br />
That I had to go through this darkness because I was being prepared for something greater.</p>

<p>Looking back, that wasn’t madness.<br />
That was a survival response.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="my-brain-was-protecting-me">My Brain Was Protecting Me</h3>

<p>Psychosis didn’t mean I was broken.<br />
It meant the weight of truth — of betrayal, of abandonment, of emotional starvation — was too heavy for me to hold all at once.</p>

<p>So my brain tried to carry it for me.<br />
By turning trauma into mythology.<br />
By turning pain into purpose.</p>

<p>And in many ways, it worked.<br />
Because I survived.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="now-i-tell-the-truth">Now I Tell the Truth</h3>

<p>Today, I no longer need fantasy to make sense of what happened.</p>

<p>It hurt because it <em>should</em> have hurt.<br />
I felt alone because I <em>was</em> alone.<br />
And I broke because no one came to hold me when I needed it most.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean I’m unlovable.<br />
Or unworthy.<br />
Or broken beyond repair.</p>

<p>It means I’ve lived through something <em>real</em>.<br />
And I’m still here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="im-rewriting-it-now">I’m Rewriting It Now</h3>

<p>This is what healing looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Naming what really happened.</li>
  <li>Honoring the ways I coped.</li>
  <li>Letting myself grieve the love I didn’t get.</li>
  <li>And writing a new story — not from delusion, but from truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not the chosen one.<br />
I’m just someone who never got what they needed.<br />
And I’m learning to give it to myself now.</p>

<p>That’s enough.</p>

<p>That’s everything.</p>
