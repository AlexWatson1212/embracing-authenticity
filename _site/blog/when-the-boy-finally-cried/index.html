      <h1>When the Boy Finally Cried</h1>

        <p class="post-description">This time, the tears didn’t come from the man holding it all together — but from the boy who finally felt safe enough to feel.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I was walking behind a couple this morning — arms linked, quietly connected. Not loud. Not performative. Just <em>there.</em> A kind of simple, steady companionship.</p>

<p>And I felt it — envy.<br />
Not the bitter kind.<br />
Not the kind that says, <em>“They shouldn’t have that.”</em><br />
But the kind that quietly whispers, <em>“I want that too.”</em></p>

<p>It wasn’t about the display — it was about what it represented:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Acceptance. Presence. Being chosen, without needing to be earned.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as I kept walking, something else rose up. A kind of ache.<br />
Not just from the man in me — but from the <em>boy.</em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-big-boys-dont-cry">🌫️ “Big Boys Don’t Cry”</h3>

<p>That old script came up almost automatically.</p>

<p>Even now, after all the healing, part of me still wants to explain away my emotion. To clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“These aren’t deep, uncontrollable sobs. Just a silent weep. Nothing dramatic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I know what that is — it’s my ego, still trying to protect the boy from being shamed.</p>

<p>The truth is:<br />
These tears weren’t weakness.<br />
They were <em>release.</em><br />
A soft grieving for the love I never got.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-boy-who-wasnt-allowed-to-feel">👦 The Boy Who Wasn’t Allowed to Feel</h3>

<p>It’s not that I’ve never cried. I’ve cried on runs. In therapy. In quiet moments at home.<br />
But lately, I’ve realized — it’s not always <em>me</em> crying.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it’s the younger part of me — the boy who wasn’t held.<br />
The one who had to grow up too soon.<br />
The one who thought that staying quiet, staying small, staying strong would somehow keep him safe.</p>

<p>And now, when tears come, I don’t just feel sadness.<br />
I feel <em>recognition.</em><br />
Like something buried is finally being witnessed.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-different-kind-of-strength">🕊️ A Different Kind of Strength</h3>

<p>I don’t want to be the kind of man who holds everything in.<br />
I don’t want to be admired for how much I can carry without breaking.<br />
I want to be real — even when it’s raw. Even when it’s tender.</p>

<p>Because that boy in me never stopped needing love.<br />
He just stopped expecting it.</p>

<p>And now, when I cry, I’m not ashamed.<br />
I’m proud.</p>

<p>Because it means he’s still here.<br />
Still feeling.<br />
Still hoping.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s what healing really is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Letting the boy finally cry —<br />
and letting the man finally listen.</p>
</blockquote>
