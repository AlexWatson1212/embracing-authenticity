      <h1>Embracing the Lonely Middle</h1>

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I don’t know how to do it.<br />
But I know I have to do it.</p>

<p>I thought connection would gently ease in as I healed. And maybe some of it has.<br />
There are sparks — people at college who I feel a sense of potential with.<br />
But I can’t rely on one environment to meet every emotional need I have.</p>

<p>And yet, I’m tired. My energy is limited.<br />
I’m trying to be mindful — not to force things, not to overextend, not to chase.</p>

<p>It’s not an excuse.<br />
It’s just where I am.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-things-ive-already-done">The Things I’ve Already Done</h3>

<p>I’ve stopped giving energy to places and people where connection was always out of reach.<br />
That took something. That’s a beginning.<br />
And in doing that, I’ve created a little more internal space —<br />
space where I’m more regulated, more open, more available.</p>

<p>But connection hasn’t landed yet in the way I imagined.<br />
And maybe that’s because it rarely does.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-im-longing-for">What I’m Longing For</h3>

<p>Yes, I think I want a relationship.<br />
But underneath that, what I’m really longing for is <strong>connection</strong>.</p>

<p>To be seen. To see someone.<br />
To feel safe. To feel wanted.<br />
To relax around another human being — not because I’m performing, but because I’m finally able to just <em>be</em>.</p>

<p>And maybe that starts with smaller things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good conversation at college.</li>
  <li>A shared moment with someone I barely know.</li>
  <li>A smile that lingers just a little longer than usual.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the footholds.<br />
And right now, I’m in the lonely middle — no longer starving for crumbs, but not yet sitting at the table.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="this-part-is-sacred-too">This Part is Sacred, Too</h3>

<p>It’s easy to think this stage is meaningless — the waiting, the middle, the quiet.<br />
But it’s not.</p>

<p>This is the part where I choose integrity over desperation.<br />
Where I walk the talk. Where I let the discomfort mature me instead of harden me.<br />
Where I remind myself that not being chosen by someone doesn’t mean I’ve failed. It just means I’m still on the way.</p>

<p>This is where I build the kind of foundation that can <em>hold</em> the love I long for — when it finally arrives.</p>

<p>And until then?</p>

<p>I’ll keep showing up.<br />
Not perfectly. Not always gracefully.<br />
But honestly.</p>

<p><strong>Because the lonely middle might just be the birthplace of something real.</strong></p>
