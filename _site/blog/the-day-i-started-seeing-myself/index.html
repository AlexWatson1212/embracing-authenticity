—</p>

<p>Today I learned a lot about myself. Not by solving anything. Not by pushing through. But by finally sitting still long enough to hear the truth I’ve been avoiding:</p>

<p>I’m exhausted — spiritually, emotionally, physically.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s not because I’ve done too little, but because I’ve carried too much. For too long. Alone.</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize that I don’t give myself credit — not for how far I’ve come, not for the father I am, not for the way I hold it all together. My parents set the bar so low emotionally that I don’t even feel proud when I do better. It’s like I unconsciously replaced “better than them” with “I must be perfect,” and that’s left me always feeling like I’m failing.</p>

<p>But today, something shifted.<br />
My son broke a curtain rail.<br />
Then he knocked over a glass of water near the electrics.<br />
And I felt frustrated.<br />
But I didn’t explode.<br />
I didn’t shut down.<br />
I stayed.</p>

<p>And even though part of me wanted to disconnect, I explained how I felt. I let him see me — not as a perfect parent, but as a <strong>human</strong>. I didn’t abandon him. I didn’t abandon myself. And in that moment, I realized something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I’m a good enough father.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have qualities I would have killed for in a father. I listen. I explain. I take space for myself, and I invite my son into that space with honesty. I give him what I never had.</p>

<p>Later, when I noticed myself overeating cake and my body battery dropping to 24, I almost spiraled. But then I realized: I wasn’t failing. My body was simply showing me that today, it felt safe enough to let things rise. The emotional weight I’ve been carrying for years finally had room to breathe.</p>

<p>Maybe this was the right time to finally express my authentic self to my son.<br />
Maybe I’m learning to listen to what my body wants.<br />
Maybe — for the first time — I’m being truly respectful to myself.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s enough.</p>
