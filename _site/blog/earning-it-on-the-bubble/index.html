        <p>Today I cashed for $200 in a bounty tournament, and while it might not sound like much, I’m honestly proud of how I played. It wasn’t about running hot, or hitting big hands at the right time. It was about <strong>holding my nerve</strong> when it mattered most — and that’s where the real growth lives.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-bubble-phase">The Bubble Phase</h3>

<p>I found myself hovering just above the danger zone, with a short stack, watching other players panic or overreach. At one point, I had to fold hands like <strong>Ace-Queen</strong>, <strong>Ace-Jack</strong>, and even <strong>Ace-King</strong> — hands that would normally be slam-dunk jams or calls.</p>

<p>But this wasn’t a normal spot.</p>

<p>This was the ICM bubble.</p>

<p>And <strong>one bad decision</strong> — one mistimed shove — would’ve meant going home with nothing.</p>

<p>So I waited.</p>

<p>I watched players with bigger stacks than mine throw their tournament lives away with reckless calls and wide shoves, and I reminded myself:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s not about how strong the hand is — it’s about how dangerous the spot is.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="cashing-through-patience">Cashing Through Patience</h3>

<p>Eventually, the short stacks busted. The money bubble burst. And I was still alive.</p>

<p>It might have looked passive from the outside, but every fold was a conscious, difficult choice. Every pause, a battle against ego.<br />
<strong>It’s not easy folding AK on a short stack.</strong><br />
It’s not easy trusting that survival — not action — is the most profitable move in that moment.</p>

<p>But I did. And it paid off.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-final-hand">The Final Hand</h3>

<p>With about 1.5 big blinds left, I picked up a playable hand. I flopped trip threes — a miracle — but got cracked by a straight on the river.</p>

<p>And I was okay with it.</p>

<p>Because I didn’t go out on tilt. I didn’t punt.<br />
I went out knowing I’d played the bubble <strong>exactly how I needed to</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="long-term-perspective">Long-Term Perspective</h3>

<p>This is where real tournament profit comes from.<br />
Not the flashy bluffs or the wild hero calls — but the quiet, gritty decisions in high-pressure moments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Folding good hands</li>
  <li>Watching others make mistakes</li>
  <li>Trusting that the math and timing are on your side</li>
</ul>

<p>It may not look dramatic. It may even seem boring.</p>

<p>But these are the hands — or non-hands — that <strong>build a winning career</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It may look straightforward, but holding your nerve in those situations is not as easy as it looks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was one of those days where I earned every chip.<br />
And that $200 cash? That’s just the start.</p>
