      <h1>Sitting With Emptiness</h1>

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>Lately I’ve been sitting with something I usually try to avoid:<br />
That deep, quiet feeling of <strong>emptiness</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s not loud. It doesn’t scream or demand anything from me.<br />
It’s just <em>there</em> — like a still fog resting over everything.<br />
Not sadness exactly, not numbness either.<br />
Just a hollow kind of space inside that whispers, <em>“Something’s missing.”</em></p>

<p>And I’ve noticed how quickly I try to fill it.</p>

<p>With noise.<br />
With tasks.<br />
With people.<br />
With food.<br />
With scrolling.<br />
With stories in my head about what’s wrong with me or what I need to fix.</p>

<p>But today, I didn’t try to fill it.<br />
I let it be there.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-space-thats-always-been-there">🌫️ A Space That’s Always Been There</h3>

<p>The truth is — this emptiness has always lived inside me.<br />
It comes from all the places love didn’t reach.<br />
From all the times I needed someone and no one came.<br />
From all the moments I swallowed my needs just to keep the peace.<br />
From all the pretending that I was okay when I wasn’t.</p>

<p>And in that emptiness, I sometimes feel lonely.<br />
Not just alone, but <em>lonely</em> in the truest sense — like no one really sees me.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-gift-of-not-turning-away">🪞 The Gift of Not Turning Away</h3>

<p>But there’s also something tender here.<br />
Because when I stop running from the emptiness, I can actually hear what it’s saying.</p>

<p>It doesn’t want to be filled.<br />
It wants to be <strong>witnessed</strong>.</p>

<p>Not fixed. Not explained. Not healed in a rush.</p>

<p>Just held.<br />
Gently.<br />
Without judgment.</p>

<p>And in that stillness, there’s a strange kind of peace.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-not-forever-just-for-now">🔁 Not Forever, Just For Now</h3>

<p>I know this isn’t forever.<br />
Emptiness is a visitor — not a life sentence.<br />
And sometimes what it’s really asking for is my own presence.</p>

<p>To sit with myself the way I wish someone had once sat with me.</p>

<p>No advice.<br />
No distraction.<br />
Just… <em>presence.</em></p>

<p>So today, I gave myself that.<br />
And it was enough.</p>

<p>Not everything needs to be filled.<br />
Some spaces are sacred —<br />
And maybe this one is where the real connection begins.</p>
