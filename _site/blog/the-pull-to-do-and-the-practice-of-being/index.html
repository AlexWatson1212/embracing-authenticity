      <h1>The Pull to Do, and the Practice of Being</h1>

        <p class="post-description">A reflection on the quiet discomfort of doing nothing and learning to feel safe in simply being.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I noticed today how hard it is to just <em>sit with myself.</em></p>

<p>My dog was lying on me. It was peaceful. Safe. And still, I felt that tug — the familiar pull toward <em>doing</em>. Play poker. Work on the website. Be productive.</p>

<p>Even though poker is a game, it still carries that sense of “progress.” Something I can <em>win</em> at. Something I can <em>achieve</em>. It doesn’t matter how exhausted I am — my mind equates stillness with failure. With being lazy. With being <em>less</em>.</p>

<p>But the truth is: sitting with myself is one of the hardest, most courageous things I’ve ever tried to do.<br />
Because in that stillness, all the parts of me I’ve ignored begin to speak.<br />
And I realise how much of my life has been spent trying to outrun them.</p>

<p>My dog eventually moved away — chose the floor instead. And it stirred something. That small ache of aloneness. Not dramatic. Just a shift. Enough for my nervous system to say, <em>You’re alone again. Time to get busy.</em></p>

<p>But I wasn’t alone. I was with <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s the real work now.<br />
Not pushing through.<br />
Not fixing myself.<br />
Just being with myself — especially in those quiet moments when there’s “nothing” to do.</p>

<p>Because that’s when I’m learning:<br />
I am not what I produce.<br />
I don’t have to earn rest.<br />
I don’t have to <em>do</em> to be <em>enough.</em></p>

<p>Sometimes the bravest thing I can do is simply… <em>be here</em>.</p>
