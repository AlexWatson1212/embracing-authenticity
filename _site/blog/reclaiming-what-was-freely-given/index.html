      <h1>Reclaiming What Was Freely Given</h1>

      
        <p class="post-date">June 01, 2025</p>
      

      
        <p class="post-description">The money she gave came with strings — but I’m cutting them, and using it to build something that’s truly mine.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I’ve carried guilt for the money my mother gave me.</p>

<p>She didn’t need it, and it was money I would have inherited anyway. But still, the way she handed it over never felt entirely free.</p>

<p>It came with a tone.<br />
With a shadow.<br />
With an unspoken agreement I never signed but somehow still lived under:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Look at everything I’ve done for you.”</em><br />
<em>“Don’t forget where that came from.”</em><br />
<em>“You owe me.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I spent some of it when I was younger in ways I now regret — impulsively, often emotionally — trying to fill the holes that years of emotional neglect had carved into me. And I hoarded what was left, afraid she’d find a way to take it back, or use it against me. Because in truth, <em>she always used things against me.</em></p>

<p>And now that I have a level of financial safety — something I’ve never really known — there’s a strange discomfort in me.</p>

<p>Like I don’t deserve it.<br />
Like something bad might happen.<br />
Like I should feel guilty for having something she “gave,” even though it wasn’t truly hers to begin with — and even though it would have come to me eventually, regardless.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-why-the-guilt-lingers">💔 Why the Guilt Lingers</h3>

<p>Because the money wasn’t just money.<br />
It was the only form of care she ever really offered.</p>

<p>Not warmth.<br />
Not holding.<br />
Not presence.<br />
Not attunement.</p>

<p>Just the cold basics: shelter, and money.</p>

<p>And yet she uses them to tell herself she’s a “good mother,” even while denying and avoiding every emotional responsibility that comes with being one.</p>

<p>So of course the guilt isn’t clean.<br />
Because the love never was.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-the-truth-im-holding-now">🕯️ The Truth I’m Holding Now</h3>

<p>She passed on that money.<br />
And I accepted it.</p>

<p>But I no longer accept the emotional strings that were tied to it.<br />
Because now I see what it was really about — <em>her needs, not mine.</em></p>

<p>And now I’m using that money not to impress her, not to escape my pain, and not to prove anything.</p>

<p>I’m using it to build something different.<br />
Something <em>mine.</em></p>

<p>Something peaceful.<br />
Something stable.<br />
Something I would want my son to inherit — not just financially, but emotionally.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-letter-to-myself">✉️ A Letter to Myself</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>You didn’t take anything that wasn’t already yours.<br />
You didn’t manipulate, demand, or exploit.<br />
You received what was passed on — and now you get to choose what it means.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This money is not a debt.<br />
It’s not a leash.<br />
It’s not a symbol of shame.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a resource.<br />
It’s an opportunity.<br />
It’s a second chance — not for her, but for <em>you.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You get to use it to create a life that reflects your truth.<br />
A life rooted in emotional honesty, not performance.<br />
A life where your son will never have to wonder if love comes with strings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve earned this life.<br />
Not because she handed over the money —<br />
But because you survived what couldn’t be bought.</p>
