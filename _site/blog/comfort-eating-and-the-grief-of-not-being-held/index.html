      <div class="post-body">
        <p>It’s a rainy Sunday.</p>

<p>I’ve just come back from shopping and noticed I’ve eaten more than I intended to.<br />
Some ice cream.<br />
Two pain au chocolats.<br />
A couple of lollies.<br />
Nothing extreme — just more than I usually would.<br />
And I know why.</p>

<p>I’m not hungry.<br />
I’m looking for comfort.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-food-as-a-stand-in-for-connection">🍫 Food as a Stand-In for Connection</h3>

<p>It’s not about the sugar.<br />
It’s about the <em>soothing.</em></p>

<p>The act of eating gives me something — warmth, fullness, a moment of satisfaction.<br />
But it’s also a mirror. A reflection of something deeper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I don’t have anyone I can reliably reach out to when I feel low.</em><br />
<em>No one to hold me, or listen, or just sit with me in the quiet.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to reach out to my mother, but it always left me emptier.<br />
I never felt <em>met</em> — just managed.<br />
The interaction often highlighted how lonely I actually was.</p>

<p>So instead, I eat.<br />
Not fast food. Not in secret. Just more than I need — a quiet act of trying to fill the space where care should be.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-this-isnt-about-willpower">🧠 This Isn’t About Willpower</h3>

<p>And I’m not beating myself up about it.<br />
I’m running.<br />
I’m eating mostly well.<br />
I’m slowly losing weight.</p>

<p>But I know that if I don’t find new ways to <em>honour the need beneath the craving</em>, this pattern will keep repeating.<br />
Because this isn’t about discipline.<br />
It’s about grief.</p>

<p>It’s the grief of not being held.<br />
The grief of doing it alone.<br />
The grief of having comfort but not connection.</p>

<p>And honestly?<br />
Eating like this is still better than some of the other ways I’ve tried to cope in the past.<br />
It’s softer. Gentler.<br />
It still comes from the part of me trying to survive.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-moment-of-self-compassion">🕯️ A Moment of Self-Compassion</h3>

<p>If I could say something to myself right now, it would be this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>You’re not bad for wanting comfort.<br />
You’re not weak for needing something.<br />
You’re just someone who’s carried a lot alone.</em></p>

  <p><em>You’ve been your own source of care for a long time.<br />
And sometimes, that care looks like a pastry and a blanket.<br />
That’s okay.</em></p>

  <p><em>But you also deserve to be held — not just fed.<br />
And that hunger deserves to be seen.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>I don’t have a perfect ending for this.<br />
Just a recognition.</p>

<p>That food isn’t the problem.<br />
Loneliness is.</p>

<p>And the more I can meet myself with tenderness — in these small, imperfect moments — the less I’ll need to reach for something else to do it for me.</p>
