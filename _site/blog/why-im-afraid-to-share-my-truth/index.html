      <h1>Why I’m Afraid to Share My Truth</h1>

        <p class="post-description">The fear of being seen runs deep when love once depended on hiding. This is what I’m learning to face.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I’ve been noticing a resistance lately — this deep, quiet fear around sharing the Embracing Authenticity project fully. Around letting myself be seen. Around letting people know who I really am.</p>

<p>At first, I thought maybe it was just perfectionism. Or timing. Or not feeling “ready.”</p>

<p>But when I sit with it, it feels like something much older. Much deeper.</p>

<p>I think I’m afraid because some part of me still believes that if I show people who I truly am, they’ll leave.</p>

<p>And that fear didn’t come out of nowhere.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-the-original-abandonment">🌫️ The Original Abandonment</h3>

<p>When I look back, my mother never really loved me in the way I needed.<br />
She didn’t nurture me.<br />
She didn’t see me.<br />
She didn’t consider what I wanted, or who I was becoming.</p>

<p>And what’s even harder to admit — I think she liked it when I was desperate for her approval. Because in that space, <em>she held the power.</em> She could give or withhold love. And I would keep trying, keep bending, keep proving.</p>

<p>So now, as an adult, when I create something that reflects my deepest truth — my real self — it stirs up that old terror:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“What if no one wants this? What if they walk away?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the truth is…<br />
<strong>She already walked away.</strong><br />
Not physically, but emotionally — from the very beginning.</p>

<p>So I’m not really afraid of being abandoned again.<br />
I’m afraid of <em>reliving</em> what I already lived through.<br />
And that’s what makes this so hard.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-risk-of-being-seen">🧡 The Risk of Being Seen</h3>

<p>There’s something vulnerable about building a project like this — about showing people the real me. Because it’s not a performance. It’s not filtered through what I think others want to hear.</p>

<p>It’s <em>me.</em> Quietly, honestly, imperfectly… me.</p>

<p>And that’s what makes it both terrifying and sacred.</p>

<p>Because the fear isn’t just fear.<br />
It’s <em>grief.</em><br />
It’s the pain of never having been accepted when it mattered most.<br />
And the cautious hope that maybe this time, it could be different.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-truth-im-holding-onto">🕯️ A Truth I’m Holding Onto</h3>

<p>I already feel unseen by most people.<br />
So what is it I’m really afraid of losing?</p>

<p>Not everyone will get it.<br />
But the right people might.<br />
And they’ll only find me if I let myself be found.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean I need to shout or overshare or bare everything at once.<br />
It just means <em>not hiding.</em></p>

<p>And that’s a risk I want to take.<br />
Because the life I want — the connection I long for — doesn’t exist behind a mask.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-if-this-resonates">🌱 If This Resonates</h3>

<p>If you’ve felt this too — the fear of being seen, the resistance to sharing what matters — I just want to say:</p>

<p>You’re not alone.<br />
And the fact that you found your way to these words means that <em>your inner voice</em> is still alive.<br />
Still guiding you.<br />
Still hoping.</p>

<p>Let that be your sign.<br />
You’re not broken for being afraid.<br />
You’re just someone who’s learning to be seen — maybe for the first time.</p>
