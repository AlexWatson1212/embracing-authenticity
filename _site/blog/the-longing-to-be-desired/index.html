        <p class="post-description">Exploring the quiet ache of wanting to be desired — and why it’s not something to be ashamed of.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>There’s a part of me I don’t often talk about.</p>

<p>The part that longs to be desired — not just liked, not just accepted — but <em>truly wanted</em>. The kind of desire that doesn’t just tolerate your presence but lights up at the sight of you. That leans in. That lingers.</p>

<p>For a long time, I told myself I didn’t need that. That I was above it, or beyond it, or better off without it. But that wasn’t the truth. That was the survival story I had to write when I wasn’t being mirrored back as worthy. When desire felt unsafe. When I associated wanting with rejection.</p>

<p>So I suppressed it.<br />
And in its place, I became “nice.”<br />
I became “safe.”<br />
I became someone who could never be rejected — but also, someone who rarely got to be fully seen.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve started to realise that this part of me — the part that wants to feel <em>wanted</em> — isn’t weak. It’s not shameful. It’s not manipulative or selfish.<br />
It’s sacred.</p>

<p>It’s the part of me that still believes intimacy could be mutual. That someone could see me — <em>truly</em> see me — and not flinch. That desire could exist without danger. That I wouldn’t be abandoned for being too much, or shamed for being vulnerable, or punished for being real.</p>

<p>That feels like healing.</p>

<p>And yes, it’s scary.<br />
Yes, I still feel the echoes of old wounds.<br />
But I’m starting to notice: the more I allow myself to feel that desire — without judgment — the more human I feel. The more whole I feel.</p>

<p>This isn’t about rushing into connection. It’s not about needing someone to fill a gap. It’s about reclaiming a part of myself I once buried to survive.</p>

<p>I want to be desired.<br />
And that’s okay.</p>

<p>Maybe you do too.<br />
And maybe it’s time we stop pretending otherwise.</p>

<p><em>Sometimes the most radical thing we can do is admit we want to be wanted — and then, lovingly, want ourselves first.</em></p>
