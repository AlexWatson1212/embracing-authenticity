      <h1>The Safety of the Unavailable</h1>

        <p class="post-description">Exploring why I feel safer around unavailable women, and what that says about the intimacy I fear and the connection I crave.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>There’s something oddly comforting about women who are unavailable.</p>

<p>Maybe they’re married. Maybe they’re distant. Maybe they’ve made it clear — they’re not interested.<br />
And yet, somehow, that’s where I’ve felt most able to be… me.</p>

<p>Because there’s no risk of intimacy when intimacy is off the table.<br />
No threat of being fully seen, only to be fully rejected.<br />
No possibility of things going somewhere, which means no chance of them falling apart.</p>

<p>That’s not manipulative. That’s a nervous system seeking safety.</p>

<p>And it’s only now that I’m starting to understand it — not judge it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’ve felt attraction to women I can’t have, and I’ve also felt shame about it.<br />
But when I sit with that shame — when I ask what’s really underneath — I don’t find bad intentions.<br />
I find unmet needs.</p>

<p>A desire to feel wanted.<br />
A longing to be seen, but only from a safe distance.<br />
A craving for connection without the risk of abandonment.</p>

<hr />

<p>There’s a younger part of me in all of this.<br />
The boy who grew up being hurt by closeness.<br />
The one who learned that love wasn’t safe, and that wanting something — especially someone — often led to pain.</p>

<p>That part of me doesn’t need to be fixed.<br />
He needs to be listened to.<br />
He needs to know he’s not dirty or shameful for wanting to feel something, even if it’s been misdirected.</p>

<hr />

<p>I want to change this pattern — not because desiring someone is wrong — but because I want to stop running from real intimacy.<br />
I want to desire women who can meet me where I’m at.<br />
I want to be seen — not just glimpsed from afar.</p>

<p>And maybe the first step is letting myself be seen… by me.</p>

<p>Even in the places that feel a bit messy.<br />
Even in the places where shame whispers that I’m too much.</p>

<p>Maybe especially there.</p>
