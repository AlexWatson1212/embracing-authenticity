        <p>Uncertainty. That’s what this is.</p>

<p>Will I find true connection?<br />
Will I become a good therapist?<br />
Will I be a good enough father to my son?</p>

<p>These are the kinds of questions that don’t come with guarantees.<br />
And yet, somehow, I’m starting to believe the answers.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-think-i-will">I Think I Will</h3>

<p>I think I <em>will</em> be a good therapist.<br />
I think I <em>am</em> a good dad —<br />
even though I’ll never complete that role in full.<br />
It’s a job that lasts a lifetime, and one that doesn’t ask for perfection — only presence.</p>

<p>The uncertainty that lingers most is this:<br />
<strong>Will I ever have real, lasting connection?</strong></p>

<p>Not just the kind you pay for.<br />
Not just fleeting glimmers that vanish before they can root.<br />
But long-term, mutual, steady love.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-shame-of-wanting">The Shame of Wanting</h3>

<p>When I start to feel that need rise in me, there’s a part of me that wants to shove it back down.<br />
Because I’ve learned — painfully — that showing how much I <em>need</em> connection can push people away.</p>

<p>So I withhold.<br />
Not because I don’t feel it — but because I fear that feeling will make me too much, again.</p>

<p>But it’s not <em>my fault</em> I’m here.</p>

<p>I didn’t have the support I needed.<br />
I was gaslit by the people who should have nurtured me.<br />
Taught to distrust my own knowing.<br />
Made to feel responsible for my parents’ sadness, as if it were mine to fix.</p>

<p>That’s not a child’s burden.<br />
It never was.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-didnt-give-up">I Didn’t Give Up</h3>

<p>If I take a real look at the path behind me, it’s remarkable I’m still here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two stays in hospital.</li>
  <li>No addiction to numb the pain, even when the pain was loud.</li>
  <li>No running — not in the end.</li>
  <li>Just quiet, persistent walking through the fire.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could have lost myself.<br />
To weed. To porn. To food.<br />
To shame. To despair.</p>

<p>But I didn’t.<br />
I <em>chose</em> to keep showing up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-am-blossoming">I Am Blossoming</h3>

<p>No one gave me compassion for these things.<br />
In fact, many shamed me more when I revealed them.<br />
They made me feel <em>even more alone</em> in the moments I most needed to be seen.</p>

<p>So if no one else will give it to me — <em>I will</em>.</p>

<p>I am okay.<br />
I am lovable.<br />
And I love myself.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-i-know-now">What I Know Now</h3>

<p>I know that one day I’ll find beautiful people.<br />
People who love gently, and see me clearly.<br />
And I know that if I’m not quite there yet — in terms of health, regulation, ease —<br />
I can <em>get there</em>.</p>

<p>This path I’m walking — into therapy, into healing —<br />
It’s not just for others.<br />
It’s for me, too.</p>

<p>And I believe, truly, that when I’m around people who love me —<br />
<strong>I won’t just blossom. I’ll bloom.</strong></p>
