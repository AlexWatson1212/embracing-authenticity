    <h2>Body Battery Wisdom: Living Within My Limits</h2>
    <p>I’ve started using a smartwatch to track my energy—what it calls my “body battery.” At first, it was just data. A number. But over time, it’s become something more meaningful.</p>

<p>It’s become a mirror for how I treat myself.</p>

<p>I used to push through tiredness. I thought rest had to be earned. I’d override signals from my body in order to stay productive, stay disciplined, stay on track.</p>

<p>But now, I notice the number.</p>

<p>If I wake up at 72% and I’m feeling slow, I honour it. I don’t force the run. I shift my priorities. I choose activities that nourish rather than drain.</p>

<p>And when I wake up at 95%? I go for it. I take advantage of the clarity, the spark, the flow. But I still pace myself. I don’t want to burn it all down by noon.</p>

<p>The real wisdom isn’t in the number—it’s in the relationship I’ve built with it. A gentler, more responsive way of living. One that says: I don’t have to crush every day. I just need to stay attuned.</p>

<p>When I live this way, I find I’m more consistent. More creative. More emotionally balanced. Less reactive.</p>

<p>The body knows. I’m just finally listening.</p>
