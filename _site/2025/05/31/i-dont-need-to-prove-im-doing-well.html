    <h2>I Don’t Need to Prove I’m Doing Well</h2>
    <p>There was a time when I wanted people to see that I was healing. That I was thriving. That I was rising from the ashes with something to show for it.</p>

<p>I’d subtly hint at growth. Try to sound grounded. Make sure I looked like I had it all together.</p>

<p>But now? I don’t need to prove I’m doing well.</p>

<p>Some of my biggest shifts have been silent. Internal. Invisible. Things only <em>I</em> would notice—like the pause before reacting, the ability to sit with discomfort, the choice to stay in instead of people-please my way into burnout.</p>

<p>No applause. No Instagram post. Just self-trust, built moment by moment.</p>

<p>It feels different now. I don’t need someone else’s validation to confirm my progress.</p>

<p>I know I’m growing because I’m the one living it.</p>
