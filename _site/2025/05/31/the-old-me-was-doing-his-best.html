    <h2>The Old Me Was Doing His Best</h2>
    <p>I used to look back at past versions of myself and cringe.</p>

<p>The way I chased people. The way I ignored red flags. The way I lost myself trying to keep the peace or hold something together that was already falling apart.</p>

<p>I’d judge that version. Try to distance myself from him. Pretend I’d always been more self-aware than I was.</p>

<p>But the truth is… <strong>he was doing his best.</strong></p>

<p>With what he had. With what he knew. With what his nervous system could handle at the time.</p>

<p>He wasn’t weak. He wasn’t pathetic. He wasn’t broken.</p>

<p>He was just trying.</p>

<p>And I’ve realised: I don’t need to hate the old me to love who I’ve become.</p>

<p>In fact, part of healing is looking back with compassion—not shame. Saying,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You didn’t know then what you know now.<br />
But look how far you’ve come.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That version of me deserves love, too.</p>

<p>Because he’s the reason I’m here now.</p>
