    <h2>The Courage to Be Seen</h2>
    <p>There’s a quiet kind of fear that lives beneath the surface of many of us:</p>

<p>The fear of being <em>seen</em>.</p>

<p>Not just noticed. Not just looked at. But <strong>truly seen</strong> — in all our contradictions, softness, depth, and doubt.</p>

<p>Because if people see who we really are… what if they walk away?</p>

<p>So we hide.</p>

<p>We present the version of ourselves we think will be accepted — the agreeable one, the funny one, the strong one, the one who’s “fine.” And it works, to a point.</p>

<p>But it’s lonely behind the mask.</p>

<p>And eventually, it gets heavy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being seen is vulnerable — but it’s also where healing lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Letting someone see the real you is a risk. It means showing your rough edges, your unfinished healing, your honest needs. It means saying, “This is me. I hope you stay — but even if you don’t, I’m still worthy.”</p>

<p>That’s courage.</p>

<p>And that courage doesn’t need to be loud. Sometimes it looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Saying something real in a quiet room.</li>
  <li>Showing up without the polished version of yourself.</li>
  <li>Letting your guard down even when you’re not sure how it will land.</li>
</ul>

<p>You weren’t made to be invisible. You weren’t made to be a projection of what others find comfortable. You were made to <em>live</em>, <em>connect</em>, <em>breathe</em> — as you are.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Let yourself be seen. Even if your voice shakes. Even if it’s messy. You’re not too much — you’re just real. And that’s enough.</strong></p>
