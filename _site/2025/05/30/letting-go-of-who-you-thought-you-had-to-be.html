      <div class="post-body">
        <p>For so long, I tried to be the person I thought I was supposed to be.</p>

<p>The one who had it together. The one who didn’t rock the boat. The one who always smiled, always coped, always held it all in.</p>

<p>That version of me was shaped by survival. By what the world rewarded. By what I thought would keep me safe.</p>

<p>But something started to crack.</p>

<p>Not in a loud, dramatic way — more like a quiet, persistent ache. A sense that I was wearing a version of myself that no longer fit. That maybe never did.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Letting go of who you thought you had to be isn’t weakness.<br />
It’s the beginning of honesty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s grieving the version of yourself that kept you alive — while making space for the one that can help you truly live.</p>

<p>And it’s messy.</p>

<p>You might not know who you are without the mask. You might feel lost, exposed, unsure of where to place your feet. That’s okay.</p>

<p>Because what you’re doing is brave.</p>

<p>You’re rewriting the rules. Redefining strength. Giving yourself permission to soften where you used to brace.</p>

<p>You’re learning that your worth isn’t in how well you perform. It’s in how honestly you live.</p>

<p>So take a breath. Let the layers fall. You don’t need to be everything for everyone anymore.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>You’re allowed to become who you really are — even if it means letting go of who they taught you to be.</strong></p>
