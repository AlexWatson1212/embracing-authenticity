      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I used to play a game that involved a lot of decision-making under pressure.</p>

<p>At first, I thought winning would prove something — that I was good enough, smart enough, or maybe just worthy of something I hadn’t yet received. I chased outcomes. I watched the scoreboard. Every success was a brief sigh of relief. Every loss echoed something deeper.</p>

<p>But something shifted.</p>

<p>Over time, I realised the game wasn’t really about winning. Not for me.<br />
It was about <em>solving the puzzle</em>.</p>

<p>Every hand became a moment to sit with uncertainty. To think clearly. To act with integrity even when the outcome was out of my control.</p>

<p>It taught me when to wait.<br />
When to trust my gut.<br />
When to walk away — not because I was afraid, but because it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>These lessons didn’t stay in the game.</p>

<p>They followed me into my relationships. Into parenting. Into moments where the “correct” choice wasn’t always obvious, and I had to act anyway.</p>

<p>It’s strange how something that once felt like a contest slowly became something more reflective. More revealing. More human.</p>

<p>I’m not chasing wins anymore.<br />
I’m here for the process.<br />
For the chance to grow.</p>

<p>And that, in itself, is the win.</p>
