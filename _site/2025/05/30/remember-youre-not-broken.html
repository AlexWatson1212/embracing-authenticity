    <h2>Remember: You’re Not Broken</h2>
    <p>There’s a quiet lie that so many of us carry.</p>

<p>That we’re broken. Flawed beyond repair. That if people knew the real us — the messy, anxious, tired, too-much or not-enough version — they’d turn away.</p>

<p>But here’s the truth:</p>

<p><strong>You’re not broken.</strong></p>

<p>You’ve been wounded, sure. Shaped by pain. Molded by expectations that were never truly yours. But underneath all that?</p>

<p>You’re whole. Always were.</p>

<p>Sometimes healing isn’t about fixing anything. It’s about <em>unlearning</em> — letting go of the beliefs, patterns, and roles you had to adopt just to survive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Healing is remembering who you were before the world taught you to be small.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This journey you’re on — it’s not a self-improvement project. It’s a <strong>self-reclamation</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s okay to grieve the time you spent thinking you were broken. To mourn the energy spent trying to be “better” when you were already enough.</p>

<p>And it’s also okay to feel resistance when you read this. That voice that says “yeah, but not me.” I know that voice. I carried it for years.</p>

<p>But I promise you — you are not beyond repair. Because you were never shattered in the first place.</p>

<p>You are <em>becoming</em> again.</p>

<p>More yourself.</p>

<p>More free.</p>

<p>More whole.</p>

<p>And that’s not because you’ve fixed everything — it’s because you finally stopped believing you were broken in the first place.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>You’re not broken. You’re remembering. And that’s more than enough.</strong></p>
