        <p>Some days, it’s not just the hands I lose — it’s what they represent.</p>

<p>Today, I made the right moves. I played the math. I stayed disciplined. I kept showing up.<br />
And still… I lost.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sevens vs. Ace-Jack:</strong> flipped deep in a major — gone.</li>
  <li><strong>Nines vs. Jacks in a bounty builder turbo:</strong> over-shoved with 20 bigs, gone.</li>
  <li><strong>Bubble pressure hands:</strong> played smart, walked away empty.</li>
</ul>

<p>And it’s not that the individual hands were bad. They weren’t.<br />
It’s the <strong>accumulation</strong> that gets me.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-when-poker-feeds-the-inner-critic">🧠 When Poker Feeds the Inner Critic</h3>

<p>Some days, these losses just roll off.<br />
But today, they hit deeper.<br />
Today, they touched that place that still believes <em>“I’m not enough.”</em></p>

<p>And I know — rationally — that’s not true.<br />
But emotionally? After a day of grief, of sitting with the pain of not being held, of never really having my needs met… poker just <em>mirrored it back to me.</em></p>

<p>The randomness. The helplessness.<br />
The <strong>longing to be rewarded</strong> for doing things right — and still watching it fall apart.</p>

<p>That’s not about cards.<br />
That’s about life.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-weight-i-was-already-carrying">💔 The Weight I Was Already Carrying</h3>

<p>I’ve been sitting with the grief of never being held.<br />
Not properly. Not consistently.<br />
I’ve had to be my own comfort for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>And it’s exhausting.</p>

<p>So when the flips don’t go my way, it’s not just about the chips.<br />
It’s about everything they reflect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Even when I show up well… I don’t win.”</em><br />
<em>“Even when I try… it’s not enough.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not tilt. That’s trauma.</p>

<p>And I’m naming it, not to drown in it — but to move through it.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-and-then-i-hit-the-8">🎯 And Then I Hit the 8</h3>

<p>Later in the same tournament, I shoved <strong>Ace-9 off for seven bigs</strong> into a short-stacked UTG opener with a $20 bounty.<br />
He flipped over <strong>Aces.</strong> Of course he did.<br />
But somehow — <em>I hit a straight on the turn.</em> I won.</p>

<p>And then again — <strong>Ace-8 offsuit</strong>, I shoved for eight bigs.<br />
Called by <strong>Ace-5 suited</strong>. Then <strong>Ace-King suited</strong> behind that.<br />
And somehow — <em>I hit an 8.</em></p>

<p>I didn’t celebrate wildly. I didn’t feel redeemed.<br />
But I felt <em>something shift.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not everything goes against me.<br />
Not every hand ends in silence.<br />
Sometimes, I hit the 8.<br />
And that’s enough — for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-the-real-game-im-playing">🕊️ The Real Game I’m Playing</h3>

<p>I’m not just playing poker.<br />
I’m playing the long game of healing.<br />
The game of staying regulated when life (and variance) keeps saying <em>“Not yet.”</em></p>

<p>And I’m not broken because it gets to me.<br />
I’m not weak because I feel it more on some days.</p>

<p>I’m just someone who’s lost more than his fair share —<br />
But still keeps sitting down,<br />
Still keeps showing up,<br />
Still keeps hoping for the next card to fall in his favour.</p>

<p>And sometimes, it does.</p>
