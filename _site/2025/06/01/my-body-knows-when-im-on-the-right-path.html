    <h2>My Body Knows When I'm on the Right Path</h2>
    <p>Something remarkable happened today.</p>

<p>I spoke honestly — not just surface-level truth, but the kind of raw, unfiltered truth I’ve protected for years. I let it out.<br />
And immediately, I felt it in my body.</p>

<p>My energy went up. My body battery <em>increased</em>.<br />
At 4 p.m., a time when I’m usually winding down, I felt <strong>more alive</strong>.</p>

<p>Not anxious. Not over-stimulated.<br />
Just… <strong>free.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="this-is-the-power-of-speaking-truth">This Is the Power of Speaking Truth</h2>

<p>What I shared wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t performative.<br />
It was intimate, vulnerable, and honest.<br />
And somehow, <strong>that gave me energy</strong>.</p>

<p>That alone tells me something important:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was <em>meant</em> to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To write.<br />
To reflect.<br />
To speak.<br />
To offer what I’ve learned — not as a finished product, but as someone still on the path.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="everything-ive-protected-is-ready-to-be-released">Everything I’ve Protected is Ready to Be Released</h2>

<p>For so long, I’ve kept things compact and quiet. Hidden in shame. Repressed.<br />
Not because I had nothing to say — but because I thought saying it was dangerous.</p>

<p>But now, it’s different.<br />
Now, that part of me is <em>begging</em> to be let out —<br />
not for attention,<br />
not for validation,<br />
but because it might actually <strong>help someone</strong>.</p>

<p>That possibility — that <em>even one person</em> could find a glimmer of hope in what I share —<br />
makes all the fear <strong>irrelevant</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="this-is-the-example-i-want-to-set">This Is the Example I Want to Set</h2>

<p>Even if no one ever reads my blog…<br />
Even if my words are lost in the void…<br />
Even if I never get recognition or praise…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>At least I tried.</strong><br />
<strong>At least I was honest.</strong><br />
<strong>At least I stood for what I believed in, despite the fear.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the legacy I want to leave.<br />
Not a polished image. Not a perfect life.<br />
But a <strong>real one</strong> — rooted in authenticity, guided by integrity.</p>

<p>As a father, that’s the example I want to set for my son.<br />
And for me, there’s nothing more important than that.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="my-body-knew-it-first">My Body Knew It First</h2>

<p>Before my mind caught up, my body told me:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“This is right. Keep going.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so I will.</p>

<p>Slowly. Gently. Courageously.<br />
One truth at a time.</p>
