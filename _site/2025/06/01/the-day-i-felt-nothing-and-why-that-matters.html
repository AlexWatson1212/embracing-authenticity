    <h2>The Day I Felt Nothing — And Why That Matters</h2>
    <p>I saw someone today — someone I used to have a complicated dynamic with.</p>

<p>A neighbour I had to set strong boundaries with.<br />
Someone who entered my house without permission more than once.<br />
Someone who used my presence to meet his own needs, but couldn’t hold space for mine.<br />
Someone who took up more emotional room than he was ever invited to.</p>

<p>And today, I saw him in Asda.<br />
We made eye contact.<br />
And I felt… nothing.</p>

<p>No awkwardness.<br />
No inner conflict.<br />
No desire to avoid.<br />
No need to explain or perform.</p>

<p>Just… indifference.<br />
And to me, that <em>means everything.</em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-what-this-taught-me">⚖️ What This Taught Me</h3>

<p>For a long time, I wasn’t taught that I had a right to my space.<br />
Not emotional space.<br />
Not physical space.<br />
Not psychological space.</p>

<p>I learned that people could come and go, that my boundaries were suggestions, not truths.<br />
I learned to manage other people’s feelings before my own.<br />
I learned to shrink, to adapt, to explain.</p>

<p>And I unlearned all of that the hard way.</p>

<p>So when I say I felt nothing when I saw him, I don’t mean I’m numb.<br />
I mean I’m <em>clear.</em></p>

<p>I know what I allow into my life.<br />
I know that no one gets access to me unless I say so.<br />
I know that I don’t need to make space for people who don’t know how to honour mine.</p>

<p>And that knowledge didn’t come from a book.<br />
It came from boundaries set, lessons lived, tears cried, and self-trust slowly rebuilt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-what-indifference-really-means">🧭 What Indifference Really Means</h3>

<p>Indifference isn’t cruelty.<br />
It’s peace.</p>

<p>It’s what happens when a dynamic that used to pull at your energy now has no access to you.<br />
It’s the quiet evidence that something in you has healed.</p>

<p>I used to think healing would feel like power. Like strength.<br />
But today, it felt like nothing.<br />
And it was everything.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you’re learning to set boundaries — and it feels clumsy or heavy or unnatural — keep going.<br />
Because one day, you’ll walk past someone who used to take up far too much of your emotional life, and you’ll feel… nothing.</p>

<p>And that moment will say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I’m not available for that anymore.<br />
Not because I’m angry.<br />
But because I’m free.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
