        <p class="post-description">A reflection on how I used to justify my desires through others, and what it means to finally claim what I want for myself — without apology.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I’ve noticed a pattern in myself lately — one that’s been there for years, maybe forever.</p>

<p>When I want something, when I feel drawn toward something that feels deeply <em>me</em>, I don’t allow myself to simply want it. I don’t allow myself to say, <em>“I’m doing this because I want to.”</em></p>

<p>Instead, I justify it through someone else.</p>

<p>I said I was buying that car to help my mum.<br />
But really? I wanted it for myself.</p>

<p>I said I was building this website for my son.<br />
But really? It’s for me — to finally express myself, to be seen, even if only by me at first.</p>

<p>It feels almost wrong to admit that. Like I’ve broken some unspoken rule about needing to be useful, selfless, productive. But the truth is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It was always for me. I just didn’t know I was allowed to say that.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a long time, I couldn’t. I had to filter everything I did through someone else’s benefit — because I was never taught that my desires were valid on their own.</p>

<p>But now I’m realizing something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wanting something for <em>me</em> isn’t selfish — it’s <em>self-honoring</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the irony is, even when I do it for myself, it still ripples outward.<br />
My son learns by watching.<br />
My inner child learns by being listened to.<br />
My life takes shape not through performance, but through <strong>truth</strong>.</p>

<p>So this website? This car? These quiet decisions I’ve made that I used to hide behind excuses?</p>

<p>They’re mine.</p>

<p>And I’m learning that <strong>they’re allowed to be</strong>.</p>
