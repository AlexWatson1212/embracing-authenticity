      <h1>Maybe This Website Is Me Trying to Be Seen</h1>

      
        <p class="post-date">June 03, 2025</p>
      

      
        <p class="post-description">A quiet reflection on why creating this website might be more than a project — it might be an act of healing, of finally allowing myself to be seen.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>Maybe this website is a way of healing myself.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s not about building something “impressive” or useful to others — maybe it’s about finally expressing who I really am. And if anyone were to read it, they wouldn’t be seeing a curated version of me. They’d be seeing the <em>real</em> parts — the ones I’ve kept hidden, the ones I’ve struggled to reveal, even to myself.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s why there’s so much resistance in sharing it.</p>

<p>Because I’ve never truly been seen and accepted before. Not as I am. Maybe I’ve experienced glimmers of it — with therapists, maybe with a few friends at college — but even then, I’m not sure I let myself <em>fully</em> be known.</p>

<p>It’s possible I’ve been protecting myself by only letting people see the parts that feel safe to show. It’s possible that some deeper parts still haven’t surfaced yet — and maybe those parts hold the key to healing the ache I’ve always carried.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m closer than I think.<br />
Or maybe I’m further than I want to believe.<br />
Maybe both are true.</p>

<p>But maybe I don’t need to know where I am on the map.<br />
Maybe the work is simply in sitting with what’s here.<br />
Maybe there is no path, and <em>that’s the path</em>.<br />
And maybe, if I choose to keep sitting with it — this uncertainty, this need, this tenderness — I’ll find my way back to myself.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s enough for now.</p>
