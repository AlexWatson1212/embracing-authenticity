        <p class="post-description">A raw reflection on unmet needs, nervous system healing, and finding safety in unexpected places.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I want to be held.<br />
I want to feel safe.<br />
I want to be seen — not for what I can do, but for who I am.</p>

<p>That longing has lived in me for as long as I can remember, but I’ve often avoided it. Instead, I’ve filled it with food, porn, or moments of fleeting closeness — anything to ease the ache that I’ve been taught to feel shame about. But there’s no shame in wanting connection. There never was.</p>

<p>I used to think I couldn’t meet that need without someone else. But I’m starting to understand myself differently now. I <em>can</em> hold myself. I <em>can</em> ask what that part of me needs. And sometimes, it’s as simple as hugging my dog. She just <em>is</em>. She doesn’t ask me to be anyone else. She wants to be close. And honestly, my body doesn’t know the difference — in those moments, I <em>am</em> held.</p>

<p>Still, I’d love to be held by a human being. Not just sexually — though I’m not ashamed of wanting that too — but emotionally, deeply. I want to be seen, accepted, and met. And I realise now that I was getting some of that at college, especially on Wednesdays. Those days gave me emotional nourishment, moments of real connection. Now that college has ended, I feel the gap.</p>

<p>I see it now — that’s why the girl from college meant something to me. I felt emotionally safe with her, at least in glimpses. That’s also why I felt what I thought was attraction to my therapist. She <em>saw</em> me. She didn’t need me to perform. It might not have been romantic — maybe it was just my nervous system responding to being seen and accepted for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p>The same thing happened with Dave from college. He genuinely saw me — not for what I could do, but for who I was. And in a world where I’ve often been reduced to my usefulness, that meant everything.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time choosing people who weren’t ready to meet me in that place. People who couldn’t hold what I was longing for. And then I’d feel disappointed — sometimes devastated. But I’m trusting the process more now. I’m learning to stop chasing and start listening.</p>

<p>I <em>know</em> I can meet someone who holds me, emotionally and physically. My attraction to women has never been the issue — it’s the emotional safety that matters. And it may not come in the package I expect, but I’m open to that now. Maybe that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>I’ll probably still slip up sometimes — maybe reach for porn again. But I’m noticing that it’s happening less and less. And what’s come in its place? Energy. Creativity. A sense of possibility.</p>

<p>That’s the shift I want to honour today.</p>

<p>I’m learning to hold myself — and in doing so, I’m making room to be held by someone else, when the time is right.</p>

<p>And that… that feels like a quiet revolution.</p>
