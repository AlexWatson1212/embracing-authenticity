      <h1>Trusting the Process: When Good Decisions Still Hurt</h1>

        <p class="post-description">A reflection on a tough poker hand that reminds me why trusting sound logic — not results — is the real mark of growth.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>Body:</p>

<p>Sometimes, poker doesn’t punish bad decisions.
Sometimes, it punishes good ones.</p>

<p>We were six-handed in an $88 tournament. I had 40 big blinds in the small blind. The button min-raised, and I flatted with pocket nines.</p>

<p>Now, the big blind — sitting on a 10 big blind stack — shoved all in.</p>

<p>It folded back to the button, and he reshoved. All in. Forty bigs.</p>

<p>Now here’s where the spot gets interesting.</p>

<p>I’d underrepresented my hand by just calling preflop. From the button’s perspective, I likely looked capped — maybe like I had a weak suited ace, some middling connectors, or a hand I didn’t want to 3-bet. And so, when the BB jams for 10BB, the button has every reason to isolate wide. I think his range includes:</p>

<p>Small pairs (22–88)</p>

<p>Broadways like ATo+, AJo+, KQo</p>

<p>Suited aces and connectors</p>

<p>And of course, value hands — TT+</p>

<p>In other words, his iso-jam range is wide.</p>

<p>So I called with 99, thinking I’m ahead of most of that.</p>

<p>And I was.</p>

<p>The big blind had pocket eights.
The board ran out 8-9-10.
Flopped middle set. But it didn’t hold.</p>

<p>It’s easy to feel stupid after a hand like that. Easy to doubt myself.</p>

<p>But when I step back and take emotion out of it — the analysis holds.</p>

<p>Flatting pre with 99 isn’t wrong. It’s balanced.</p>

<p>BB’s 10BB shove is standard.</p>

<p>Button’s iso range should be wide given my perceived weakness.</p>

<p>Calling with 99 against that range is profitable.</p>

<p>I made the right call.
It just didn’t work out this time.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s the hardest part of poker — separating decision quality from outcome.</p>

<p>But it’s also the most important.</p>

<p>This hand didn’t teach me that I misplayed.
It taught me that I’m learning to trust myself, even when the board doesn’t go my way.</p>

<p>Because sometimes good decisions still hurt.
And that’s okay.</p>
