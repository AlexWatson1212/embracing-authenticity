        <p class="post-description">A reflection on slowing down, letting go of old survival patterns, and building trust in the self again.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>I woke up at 3 a.m. today with only a few hours of sleep.<br />
By all accounts, I should be pushing through.<br />
Play poker. Clean the house. Be productive.<br />
That’s the script I was raised with — that if I’m not <em>doing</em>, I’m falling behind.</p>

<p>But I’ve been listening more closely to myself lately. And today, my body was saying: <em>rest.</em></p>

<p>Even though my body battery said 59%, I knew I was on fumes.<br />
So instead of powering through, I took a nap. I played one more short tournament.<br />
And then I stopped. Not out of laziness — but out of <em>respect</em>.</p>

<p>There’s something countercultural about that. Something that used to feel wrong.<br />
How could I want so much from life — a partner, peace, purpose — and still let myself <em>sit</em>?</p>

<p>But I’m learning.<br />
Learning that slowing down doesn’t mean giving up.<br />
Learning that trusting the process is the most radical thing I can do right now.</p>

<p>I want to be a great partner for someone one day.<br />
And I know I will be — because I’m learning to be that for <em>myself</em> first.<br />
Not just intellectually. But in action. In stillness. In how I choose to respond when I feel overwhelmed or alone.</p>

<p>I’ve made mistakes in the past — picked people who activated my wounds instead of helping them heal.<br />
People who felt like the nurturing parent I never had, but who turned out to be the critical voice I’ve spent my life trying to quiet.</p>

<p>And I see now — I was caught in the drama triangle:<br />
Victim. Rescuer. Persecutor.<br />
Switching roles. Staying stuck. Always dysregulated.</p>

<p>But today, I’m stepping out of the triangle.<br />
I’m choosing presence over performance.<br />
And that, in itself, is healing.</p>

<p>So I’m taking it slow.<br />
Not because I’ve lost faith in life.<br />
But because I’ve finally started to trust it.</p>
