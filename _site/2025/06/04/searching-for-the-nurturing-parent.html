      <h1>Searching for the Nurturing Parent — And Finding the Critical One</h1>

        <p class="post-description">I used to unconsciously search for a nurturing parent in others — and often found the critical one instead. Now I see the pattern clearly, and I’m learning to meet myself with the compassion I was never given.</p>
      

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>Body:</p>

<p>I’ve started to see a pattern that has run through most of my relationships.</p>

<p>At some level, I think I’ve been searching for a part of myself in other people — the part that was never fully met in childhood. The nurturing parent. The one who sees me gently, holds space, offers warmth without judgment.</p>

<p>But instead of that, I often ended up with the critical parent — the voice that judges, corrects, stands one step above.
And I took the one-down position.
Again and again.</p>

<p>It’s not always obvious.
Sometimes the relationship even feels healthy on the surface.
But when I look closely, the dynamic is still there — that sense that I’m the one being helped, tolerated, subtly managed.</p>

<hr />

<p>And the truth is…
On some level, I wanted that.</p>

<p>Not the criticism, but the care. The containment. The feeling that someone could finally give me what I missed.</p>

<p>Of course I looked for it in others.
Of course I kept ending up in uneven dynamics.
Because I’d never known what it felt like to be held without hierarchy.</p>

<hr />

<p>For a long time, I denied how bad my childhood really was.
How little attunement there was.
How unskilled my parents were at parenting.</p>

<p>And because I couldn’t face that, I internalised all the shame of it.
I believed it was me. That I was too much. Too sensitive. Too needy.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t me.
The shame didn’t start in me. It was passed to me — by parents who couldn’t meet my needs, and then made me feel wrong for having them.</p>

<p>And I’ve been carrying that shame into relationships ever since.</p>

<hr />

<p>But now I see it.</p>

<p>I’m not broken for wanting to be nurtured.
I’m not weak for needing softness.
I’m just someone who never received it — and now knows how to name that wound.</p>

<p>And that changes everything.</p>

<p>Because if I can be conscious of the pattern, I don’t have to keep repeating it.
And if I can meet myself with compassion, I won’t need others to hold what I’m not willing to hold within.</p>

<p>I don’t need saving.
I don’t need fixing.
I just need truth. And care. And the kind of love that starts from within.</p>

<p>And that… I can give myself now.</p>
