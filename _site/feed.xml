<p>That we’re broken. Flawed beyond repair. That if people knew the real us — the messy, anxious, tired, too-much or not-enough version — they’d turn away.</p>

<p>But here’s the truth:</p>

<p><strong>You’re not broken.</strong></p>

<p>You’ve been wounded, sure. Shaped by pain. Molded by expectations that were never truly yours. But underneath all that?</p>

<p>You’re whole. Always were.</p>

<p>Sometimes healing isn’t about fixing anything. It’s about <em>unlearning</em> — letting go of the beliefs, patterns, and roles you had to adopt just to survive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Healing is remembering who you were before the world taught you to be small.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This journey you’re on — it’s not a self-improvement project. It’s a <strong>self-reclamation</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s okay to grieve the time you spent thinking you were broken. To mourn the energy spent trying to be “better” when you were already enough.</p>

<p>And it’s also okay to feel resistance when you read this. That voice that says “yeah, but not me.” I know that voice. I carried it for years.</p>

<p>But I promise you — you are not beyond repair. Because you were never shattered in the first place.</p>

<p>You are <em>becoming</em> again.</p>

<p>More yourself.</p>

<p>More free.</p>

<p>More whole.</p>

<p>And that’s not because you’ve fixed everything — it’s because you finally stopped believing you were broken in the first place.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>You’re not broken. You’re remembering. And that’s more than enough.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes healing begins with the radical idea that nothing is wrong with you — you're just unlearning what never belonged.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">when Disgust Is Actually Jealousy</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/When-Disgust-Is-Actually-Jealousy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="when Disgust Is Actually Jealousy" /><published>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/%20When-Disgust-Is-Actually-Jealousy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/When-Disgust-Is-Actually-Jealousy.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maybe This Is What Healing Feels Like</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/Maybe-This-Is-What-Healing-Feels-Like.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maybe This Is What Healing Feels Like" /><published>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/Maybe-This-Is-What-Healing-Feels-Like</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/Maybe-This-Is-What-Healing-Feels-Like.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I Fell in Love with the Puzzle, Not the Prize</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/Why-I-Fell-in-Love-with-the-Puzzle-Not-the-Prize.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I Fell in Love with the Puzzle, Not the Prize" /><published>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/Why-I-Fell-in-Love-with-the-Puzzle-Not-the-Prize</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/Why-I-Fell-in-Love-with-the-Puzzle-Not-the-Prize.html"><![CDATA[<p>I used to play a game that involved a lot of decision-making under pressure.</p>

<p>At first, I thought winning would prove something — that I was good enough, smart enough, or maybe just worthy of something I hadn’t yet received. I chased outcomes. I watched the scoreboard. Every success was a brief sigh of relief. Every loss echoed something deeper.</p>

<p>But something shifted.</p>

<p>Over time, I realised the game wasn’t really about winning. Not for me.<br />
It was about <em>solving the puzzle</em>.</p>

<p>Every hand became a moment to sit with uncertainty. To think clearly. To act with integrity even when the outcome was out of my control.</p>

<p>It taught me when to wait.<br />
When to trust my gut.<br />
When to walk away — not because I was afraid, but because it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>These lessons didn’t stay in the game.</p>

<p>They followed me into my relationships. Into parenting. Into moments where the “correct” choice wasn’t always obvious, and I had to act anyway.</p>

<p>It’s strange how something that once felt like a contest slowly became something more reflective. More revealing. More human.</p>

<p>I’m not chasing wins anymore.<br />
I’m here for the process.<br />
For the chance to grow.</p>

<p>And that, in itself, is the win.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to play a game that involved a lot of decision-making under pressure.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Coming Home To Myself</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/coming-home-to-myself.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Coming Home To Myself" /><published>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/coming-home-to-myself</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/coming-home-to-myself.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Leaning Into Loneliness</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/leaning-into-loneliness.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Leaning Into Loneliness" /><published>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/leaning-into-loneliness</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/leaning-into-loneliness.html"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning to Trust Again</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/learning-to-trust-again.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning to Trust Again" /><published>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/learning-to-trust-again</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/05/30/learning-to-trust-again.html"><![CDATA[<p>Trust is a fragile thing.</p>

<p>Once broken, it doesn’t rebuild easily. Not with others. Not even with ourselves.</p>

<p>We say we want to love again, open again, try again — but something in us flinches. Pulls back. Hides. And not because we’re weak… but because we’ve been wounded.</p>

<p>And yet, there’s a quiet truth underneath it all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want to trust. We <em>need</em> to trust. Because without trust, we don’t feel safe. And without safety, we can’t fully live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here’s the thing — trust doesn’t have to come back all at once.</p>

<p>It can start small:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Letting someone see you when you’re struggling.</li>
  <li>Believing a kind word without brushing it off.</li>
  <li>Sitting with discomfort instead of running from it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning to trust again isn’t a big, dramatic leap — it’s a series of gentle choices. To stay. To try. To believe that not everyone will hurt you. And more importantly… that <em>you</em> won’t abandon yourself again either.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it starts with trusting your own voice. The whisper that says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I deserve more.”<br />
“I don’t need to earn love.”<br />
“I am safe now.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rebuilding trust means making space for all of you — even the scared parts. Especially the scared parts. Because those are the ones that need the most reassurance.</p>

<p>You might not trust easily. You might still flinch. But that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It means you’re healing. Slowly. Bravely.</p>

<p>And every time you soften — even just a little — that’s trust returning.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Trust is not a destination. It’s a direction. And you’re already on the way.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trust doesn’t always come back in a flood.
