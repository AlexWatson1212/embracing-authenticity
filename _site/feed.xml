<p>When I want something, when I feel drawn toward something that feels deeply <em>me</em>, I don’t allow myself to simply want it. I don’t allow myself to say, <em>“I’m doing this because I want to.”</em></p>

<p>Instead, I justify it through someone else.</p>

<p>I said I was buying that car to help my mum.<br />
But really? I wanted it for myself.</p>

<p>I said I was building this website for my son.<br />
But really? It’s for me — to finally express myself, to be seen, even if only by me at first.</p>

<p>It feels almost wrong to admit that. Like I’ve broken some unspoken rule about needing to be useful, selfless, productive. But the truth is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It was always for me. I just didn’t know I was allowed to say that.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a long time, I couldn’t. I had to filter everything I did through someone else’s benefit — because I was never taught that my desires were valid on their own.</p>

<p>But now I’m realizing something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wanting something for <em>me</em> isn’t selfish — it’s <em>self-honoring</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the irony is, even when I do it for myself, it still ripples outward.<br />
My son learns by watching.<br />
My inner child learns by being listened to.<br />
My life takes shape not through performance, but through <strong>truth</strong>.</p>

<p>So this website? This car? These quiet decisions I’ve made that I used to hide behind excuses?</p>

<p>They’re mine.</p>

<p>And I’m learning that <strong>they’re allowed to be</strong>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Authenticity," /><category term="Healing," /><category term="Self-Worth," /><category term="Inner" /><category term="Child," /><category term="Expression" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A reflection on how I used to justify my desires through others, and what it means to finally claim what I want for myself — without apology.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Day I Started Seeing Myself</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/the-day-i-started-seeing-myself.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Day I Started Seeing Myself" /><published>2025-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/the-day-i-started-seeing-myself</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/the-day-i-started-seeing-myself.html"><![CDATA[<p>Alexander Watson <a href="mailto:alexanderclivewatson@gmail.com">alexanderclivewatson@gmail.com</a>

description: A quiet, powerful reflection on parenting, emotional exhaustion, and what it really means to be a good enough father.
—</p>

<p>Today I learned a lot about myself. Not by solving anything. Not by pushing through. But by finally sitting still long enough to hear the truth I’ve been avoiding:</p>

<p>I’m exhausted — spiritually, emotionally, physically.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s not because I’ve done too little, but because I’ve carried too much. For too long. Alone.</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize that I don’t give myself credit — not for how far I’ve come, not for the father I am, not for the way I hold it all together. My parents set the bar so low emotionally that I don’t even feel proud when I do better. It’s like I unconsciously replaced “better than them” with “I must be perfect,” and that’s left me always feeling like I’m failing.</p>

<p>But today, something shifted.<br />
My son broke a curtain rail.<br />
Then he knocked over a glass of water near the electrics.<br />
And I felt frustrated.<br />
But I didn’t explode.<br />
I didn’t shut down.<br />
I stayed.</p>

<p>And even though part of me wanted to disconnect, I explained how I felt. I let him see me — not as a perfect parent, but as a <strong>human</strong>. I didn’t abandon him. I didn’t abandon myself. And in that moment, I realized something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I’m a good enough father.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have qualities I would have killed for in a father. I listen. I explain. I take space for myself, and I invite my son into that space with honesty. I give him what I never had.</p>

<p>Later, when I noticed myself overeating cake and my body battery dropping to 24, I almost spiraled. But then I realized: I wasn’t failing. My body was simply showing me that today, it felt safe enough to let things rise. The emotional weight I’ve been carrying for years finally had room to breathe.</p>

<p>Maybe this was the right time to finally express my authentic self to my son.<br />
Maybe I’m learning to listen to what my body wants.<br />
Maybe — for the first time — I’m being truly respectful to myself.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s enough.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alexander Watson alexanderclivewatson@gmail.com 8:13 PM (2 hours ago) to me]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maybe This Website Is Me Trying to Be Seen</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/maybe-this-website-is-me-trying-to-be-seen.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maybe This Website Is Me Trying to Be Seen" /><published>2025-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/maybe-this-website-is-me-trying-to-be-seen</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/maybe-this-website-is-me-trying-to-be-seen.html"><![CDATA[<p>Maybe this website is a way of healing myself.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s not about building something “impressive” or useful to others — maybe it’s about finally expressing who I really am. And if anyone were to read it, they wouldn’t be seeing a curated version of me. They’d be seeing the <em>real</em> parts — the ones I’ve kept hidden, the ones I’ve struggled to reveal, even to myself.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s why there’s so much resistance in sharing it.</p>

<p>Because I’ve never truly been seen and accepted before. Not as I am. Maybe I’ve experienced glimmers of it — with therapists, maybe with a few friends at college — but even then, I’m not sure I let myself <em>fully</em> be known.</p>

<p>It’s possible I’ve been protecting myself by only letting people see the parts that feel safe to show. It’s possible that some deeper parts still haven’t surfaced yet — and maybe those parts hold the key to healing the ache I’ve always carried.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m closer than I think.<br />
Or maybe I’m further than I want to believe.<br />
Maybe both are true.</p>

<p>But maybe I don’t need to know where I am on the map.<br />
Maybe the work is simply in sitting with what’s here.<br />
Maybe there is no path, and <em>that’s the path</em>.<br />
And maybe, if I choose to keep sitting with it — this uncertainty, this need, this tenderness — I’ll find my way back to myself.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s enough for now.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Self-Discovery," /><category term="Healing," /><category term="Vulnerability," /><category term="Authenticity," /><category term="Expression" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quiet reflection on why creating this website might be more than a project — it might be an act of healing, of finally allowing myself to be seen.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Earning It on the Bubble</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/02/earning-it-on-the-bubble.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Earning It on the Bubble" /><published>2025-06-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/02/earning-it-on-the-bubble</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/02/earning-it-on-the-bubble.html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I cashed for $200 in a bounty tournament, and while it might not sound like much, I’m honestly proud of how I played. It wasn’t about running hot, or hitting big hands at the right time. It was about <strong>holding my nerve</strong> when it mattered most — and that’s where the real growth lives.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-bubble-phase">The Bubble Phase</h3>

<p>I found myself hovering just above the danger zone, with a short stack, watching other players panic or overreach. At one point, I had to fold hands like <strong>Ace-Queen</strong>, <strong>Ace-Jack</strong>, and even <strong>Ace-King</strong> — hands that would normally be slam-dunk jams or calls.</p>

<p>But this wasn’t a normal spot.</p>

<p>This was the ICM bubble.</p>

<p>And <strong>one bad decision</strong> — one mistimed shove — would’ve meant going home with nothing.</p>

<p>So I waited.</p>

<p>I watched players with bigger stacks than mine throw their tournament lives away with reckless calls and wide shoves, and I reminded myself:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s not about how strong the hand is — it’s about how dangerous the spot is.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="cashing-through-patience">Cashing Through Patience</h3>

<p>Eventually, the short stacks busted. The money bubble burst. And I was still alive.</p>

<p>It might have looked passive from the outside, but every fold was a conscious, difficult choice. Every pause, a battle against ego.<br />
<strong>It’s not easy folding AK on a short stack.</strong><br />
It’s not easy trusting that survival — not action — is the most profitable move in that moment.</p>

<p>But I did. And it paid off.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-final-hand">The Final Hand</h3>

<p>With about 1.5 big blinds left, I picked up a playable hand. I flopped trip threes — a miracle — but got cracked by a straight on the river.</p>

<p>And I was okay with it.</p>

<p>Because I didn’t go out on tilt. I didn’t punt.<br />
I went out knowing I’d played the bubble <strong>exactly how I needed to</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="long-term-perspective">Long-Term Perspective</h3>

<p>This is where real tournament profit comes from.<br />
Not the flashy bluffs or the wild hero calls — but the quiet, gritty decisions in high-pressure moments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Folding good hands</li>
  <li>Watching others make mistakes</li>
  <li>Trusting that the math and timing are on your side</li>
</ul>

<p>It may not look dramatic. It may even seem boring.</p>

<p>But these are the hands — or non-hands — that <strong>build a winning career</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It may look straightforward, but holding your nerve in those situations is not as easy as it looks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was one of those days where I earned every chip.<br />
And that $200 cash? That’s just the start.</p>

That’s what this is.</p>

<p>Will I find true connection?<br />
Will I become a good therapist?<br />
Will I be a good enough father to my son?</p>

<p>These are the kinds of questions that don’t come with guarantees.<br />
And yet, somehow, I’m starting to believe the answers.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-think-i-will">I Think I Will</h3>

<p>I think I <em>will</em> be a good therapist.<br />
I think I <em>am</em> a good dad —<br />
even though I’ll never complete that role in full.<br />
It’s a job that lasts a lifetime, and one that doesn’t ask for perfection — only presence.</p>

<p>The uncertainty that lingers most is this:<br />
<strong>Will I ever have real, lasting connection?</strong></p>

<p>Not just the kind you pay for.<br />
Not just fleeting glimmers that vanish before they can root.<br />
But long-term, mutual, steady love.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-shame-of-wanting">The Shame of Wanting</h3>

<p>When I start to feel that need rise in me, there’s a part of me that wants to shove it back down.<br />
Because I’ve learned — painfully — that showing how much I <em>need</em> connection can push people away.</p>

<p>So I withhold.<br />
Not because I don’t feel it — but because I fear that feeling will make me too much, again.</p>

<p>But it’s not <em>my fault</em> I’m here.</p>

<p>I didn’t have the support I needed.<br />
I was gaslit by the people who should have nurtured me.<br />
Taught to distrust my own knowing.<br />
Made to feel responsible for my parents’ sadness, as if it were mine to fix.</p>

<p>That’s not a child’s burden.<br />
It never was.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-didnt-give-up">I Didn’t Give Up</h3>

<p>If I take a real look at the path behind me, it’s remarkable I’m still here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two stays in hospital.</li>
  <li>No addiction to numb the pain, even when the pain was loud.</li>
  <li>No running — not in the end.</li>
  <li>Just quiet, persistent walking through the fire.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could have lost myself.<br />
To weed. To porn. To food.<br />
To shame. To despair.</p>

<p>But I didn’t.<br />
I <em>chose</em> to keep showing up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-am-blossoming">I Am Blossoming</h3>

<p>No one gave me compassion for these things.<br />
In fact, many shamed me more when I revealed them.<br />
They made me feel <em>even more alone</em> in the moments I most needed to be seen.</p>

<p>So if no one else will give it to me — <em>I will</em>.</p>

<p>I am okay.<br />
I am lovable.<br />
And I love myself.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-i-know-now">What I Know Now</h3>

<p>I know that one day I’ll find beautiful people.<br />
People who love gently, and see me clearly.<br />
And I know that if I’m not quite there yet — in terms of health, regulation, ease —<br />
I can <em>get there</em>.</p>

<p>This path I’m walking — into therapy, into healing —<br />
It’s not just for others.<br />
It’s for me, too.</p>

<p>And I believe, truly, that when I’m around people who love me —<br />
<strong>I won’t just blossom. I’ll bloom.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Healing," /><category term="Self-Compassion," /><category term="Therapy," /><category term="Loneliness," /><category term="Uncertainty" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncertainty.

That deep, quiet feeling of <strong>emptiness</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s not loud. It doesn’t scream or demand anything from me.<br />
It’s just <em>there</em> — like a still fog resting over everything.<br />
Not sadness exactly, not numbness either.<br />
Just a hollow kind of space inside that whispers, <em>“Something’s missing.”</em></p>

<p>And I’ve noticed how quickly I try to fill it.</p>

<p>With noise.<br />
With tasks.<br />
With people.<br />
With food.<br />
With scrolling.<br />
With stories in my head about what’s wrong with me or what I need to fix.</p>

<p>But today, I didn’t try to fill it.<br />
I let it be there.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-space-thats-always-been-there">🌫️ A Space That’s Always Been There</h3>

<p>The truth is — this emptiness has always lived inside me.<br />
It comes from all the places love didn’t reach.<br />
From all the times I needed someone and no one came.<br />
From all the moments I swallowed my needs just to keep the peace.<br />
From all the pretending that I was okay when I wasn’t.</p>

<p>And in that emptiness, I sometimes feel lonely.<br />
Not just alone, but <em>lonely</em> in the truest sense — like no one really sees me.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-gift-of-not-turning-away">🪞 The Gift of Not Turning Away</h3>

<p>But there’s also something tender here.<br />
Because when I stop running from the emptiness, I can actually hear what it’s saying.</p>

<p>It doesn’t want to be filled.<br />
It wants to be <strong>witnessed</strong>.</p>

<p>Not fixed. Not explained. Not healed in a rush.</p>

<p>Just held.<br />
Gently.<br />
Without judgment.</p>

<p>And in that stillness, there’s a strange kind of peace.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-not-forever-just-for-now">🔁 Not Forever, Just For Now</h3>

<p>I know this isn’t forever.<br />
Emptiness is a visitor — not a life sentence.<br />
And sometimes what it’s really asking for is my own presence.</p>

<p>To sit with myself the way I wish someone had once sat with me.</p>

<p>No advice.<br />
No distraction.<br />
Just… <em>presence.</em></p>

<p>So today, I gave myself that.<br />
And it was enough.</p>

<p>Not everything needs to be filled.<br />
Some spaces are sacred —<br />
And maybe this one is where the real connection begins.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Loneliness" /><category term="Emotional Healing" /><category term="Self-Reflection" /><category term="Authenticity" /><category term="Connection" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately I’ve been sitting with something I usually try to avoid: That deep, quiet feeling of emptiness.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rewriting My Origin Story</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/rewriting-my-origin-story.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rewriting My Origin Story" /><published>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/rewriting-my-origin-story</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/rewriting-my-origin-story.html"><![CDATA[<p>When I reflect back on when I went manic, I think it was a steady, progressive realization of the lack of connection and the depth of my emptiness — despite being surrounded by people who were supposed to be my friends.</p>

<p>They didn’t respect me.<br />
They didn’t truly connect with me.</p>

<p>And the more I realized that, the more weed I smoked. I progressively became more manic — until eventually, I entered psychosis.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-illusion-that-kept-me-safe">The Illusion That Kept Me Safe</h3>

<p>It started with realizing my family never really saw me.<br />
That their love came with conditions — with expectations that I’d be someone else entirely.</p>

<p>I think my mind, desperate to cope, constructed a story where I was someone <em>important</em>.<br />
Someone <em>chosen</em>.<br />
Someone whose pain <em>meant something</em>.</p>

<p>In psychosis, I remember believing I had a spiritual purpose.<br />
That I was on a mission.<br />
That I had to go through this darkness because I was being prepared for something greater.</p>

<p>Looking back, that wasn’t madness.<br />
That was a survival response.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="my-brain-was-protecting-me">My Brain Was Protecting Me</h3>

<p>Psychosis didn’t mean I was broken.<br />
It meant the weight of truth — of betrayal, of abandonment, of emotional starvation — was too heavy for me to hold all at once.</p>

<p>So my brain tried to carry it for me.<br />
By turning trauma into mythology.<br />
By turning pain into purpose.</p>

<p>And in many ways, it worked.<br />
Because I survived.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="now-i-tell-the-truth">Now I Tell the Truth</h3>

<p>Today, I no longer need fantasy to make sense of what happened.</p>

<p>It hurt because it <em>should</em> have hurt.<br />
I felt alone because I <em>was</em> alone.<br />
And I broke because no one came to hold me when I needed it most.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean I’m unlovable.<br />
Or unworthy.<br />
Or broken beyond repair.</p>

<p>It means I’ve lived through something <em>real</em>.<br />
And I’m still here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="im-rewriting-it-now">I’m Rewriting It Now</h3>

<p>This is what healing looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Naming what really happened.</li>
  <li>Honoring the ways I coped.</li>
  <li>Letting myself grieve the love I didn’t get.</li>
  <li>And writing a new story — not from delusion, but from truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not the chosen one.<br />
I’m just someone who never got what they needed.<br />
And I’m learning to give it to myself now.</p>

<p>That’s enough.</p>

<p>That’s everything.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Healing," /><category term="Trauma," /><category term="Mental" /><category term="Health," /><category term="Reflection," /><category term="Self-Compassion" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A raw reflection on psychosis, fantasy, and how my mind tried to protect me from the truth of abandonment.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Not Just the Cards</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/not-just-the-cards.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Not Just the Cards" /><published>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/not-just-the-cards</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/not-just-the-cards.html"><![CDATA[<p>Some days, it’s not just the hands I lose — it’s what they represent.</p>

<p>Today, I made the right moves. I played the math. I stayed disciplined. I kept showing up.<br />
And still… I lost.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sevens vs. Ace-Jack:</strong> flipped deep in a major — gone.</li>
  <li><strong>Nines vs. Jacks in a bounty builder turbo:</strong> over-shoved with 20 bigs, gone.</li>

It’s the <strong>accumulation</strong> that gets me.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-when-poker-feeds-the-inner-critic">🧠 When Poker Feeds the Inner Critic</h3>

<p>Some days, these losses just roll off.<br />
But today, they hit deeper.<br />
Today, they touched that place that still believes <em>“I’m not enough.”</em></p>

<p>And I know — rationally — that’s not true.<br />
But emotionally? After a day of grief, of sitting with the pain of not being held, of never really having my needs met… poker just <em>mirrored it back to me.</em></p>

<p>The randomness. The helplessness.<br />
The <strong>longing to be rewarded</strong> for doing things right — and still watching it fall apart.</p>

<p>That’s not about cards.<br />
That’s about life.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-weight-i-was-already-carrying">💔 The Weight I Was Already Carrying</h3>

<p>I’ve been sitting with the grief of never being held.<br />
Not properly. Not consistently.<br />
I’ve had to be my own comfort for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>And it’s exhausting.</p>

<p>So when the flips don’t go my way, it’s not just about the chips.<br />
It’s about everything they reflect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That’s not tilt. That’s trauma.</p>

<p>And I’m naming it, not to drown in it — but to move through it.</p>

<h3 id="-and-then-i-hit-the-8">🎯 And Then I Hit the 8</h3>

<p>Later in the same tournament, I shoved <strong>Ace-9 off for seven bigs</strong> into a short-stacked UTG opener with a $20 bounty.<br />
He flipped over <strong>Aces.</strong> Of course he did.<br />
But somehow — <em>I hit a straight on the turn.</em> I won.</p>

<p>And then again — <strong>Ace-8 offsuit</strong>, I shoved for eight bigs.<br />
Called by <strong>Ace-5 suited</strong>. Then <strong>Ace-King suited</strong> behind that.<br />
And somehow — <em>I hit an 8.</em></p>

<p>I didn’t celebrate wildly. I didn’t feel redeemed.<br />
But I felt <em>something shift.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not everything goes against me.<br />
Not every hand ends in silence.<br />
Sometimes, I hit the 8.<br />
And that’s enough — for now.</p>

<h3 id="️-the-real-game-im-playing">🕊️ The Real Game I’m Playing</h3>

<p>I’m not just playing poker.<br />
I’m playing the long game of healing.<br />
The game of staying regulated when life (and variance) keeps saying <em>“Not yet.”</em></p>

<p>And I’m not broken because it gets to me.<br />
I’m not weak because I feel it more on some days.</p>

<p>I’m just someone who’s lost more than his fair share —<br />
But still keeps sitting down,<br />
Still keeps showing up,<br />
Still keeps hoping for the next card to fall in his favour.</p>

<p>And sometimes, it does.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Poker" /><category term="Emotional Resilience" /><category term="Grief" /><category term="Healing" /><category term="Loneliness" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some days, it’s not just the hands I lose — it’s what they represent.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Embracing the Lonely Middle</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/embracing-the-lonely-middle.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Embracing the Lonely Middle" /><published>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/embracing-the-lonely-middle</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/embracing-the-lonely-middle.html"><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know how to do it.<br />
But I know I have to do it.</p>

<p>I thought connection would gently ease in as I healed. And maybe some of it has.<br />
There are sparks — people at college who I feel a sense of potential with.<br />
But I can’t rely on one environment to meet every emotional need I have.</p>

<p>And yet, I’m tired. My energy is limited.<br />
I’m trying to be mindful — not to force things, not to overextend, not to chase.</p>

<p>It’s not an excuse.<br />
It’s just where I am.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-things-ive-already-done">The Things I’ve Already Done</h3>

<p>I’ve stopped giving energy to places and people where connection was always out of reach.<br />
That took something. That’s a beginning.<br />
And in doing that, I’ve created a little more internal space —<br />
space where I’m more regulated, more open, more available.</p>

<p>But connection hasn’t landed yet in the way I imagined.<br />
And maybe that’s because it rarely does.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-im-longing-for">What I’m Longing For</h3>

<p>Yes, I think I want a relationship.<br />
But underneath that, what I’m really longing for is <strong>connection</strong>.</p>

<p>To be seen. To see someone.<br />
To feel safe. To feel wanted.<br />
To relax around another human being — not because I’m performing, but because I’m finally able to just <em>be</em>.</p>

<p>And maybe that starts with smaller things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good conversation at college.</li>
  <li>A shared moment with someone I barely know.</li>
  <li>A smile that lingers just a little longer than usual.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the footholds.<br />
And right now, I’m in the lonely middle — no longer starving for crumbs, but not yet sitting at the table.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="this-part-is-sacred-too">This Part is Sacred, Too</h3>

<p>It’s easy to think this stage is meaningless — the waiting, the middle, the quiet.<br />
But it’s not.</p>

<p>This is the part where I choose integrity over desperation.<br />
Where I walk the talk. Where I let the discomfort mature me instead of harden me.<br />
Where I remind myself that not being chosen by someone doesn’t mean I’ve failed. It just means I’m still on the way.</p>

<p>This is where I build the kind of foundation that can <em>hold</em> the love I long for — when it finally arrives.</p>

<p>And until then?</p>

<p>I’ll keep showing up.<br />
Not perfectly. Not always gracefully.<br />
But honestly.</p>

<p><strong>Because the lonely middle might just be the birthplace of something real.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Loneliness," /><category term="Self-Compassion," /><category term="Connection," /><category term="Vulnerability," /><category term="Relationships" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t know how to do it.

But… am I?</p>

<p>Am I truly open to connection?<br />
Am I <em>welcoming</em> people in — or am I quietly turning away when love starts to approach?</p>

<p>There’s a subtle kind of avoidance I’ve started to notice in myself.<br />
A subconscious flinch. A retreat into the familiar shelter of solitude, even while outwardly saying I want closeness.</p>

<p>So I asked myself honestly:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Do I really want connection? Or am I terrified of it?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the answer is: <strong>both.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-price-of-not-sitting-with-it">The Price of Not Sitting With It</h3>

<p>Here’s what I’ve realized:</p>

<p>If I don’t let myself feel the depth of this loneliness —<br />
If I keep numbing, distracting, softening it just enough to tolerate —<br />
Then I’ll never be desperate or courageous enough to seek what I truly need.</p>

<p>I’ll stay just comfortable enough in isolation.<br />
Safe, but disconnected.<br />
Alive, but not living.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="a-quiet-kind-of-gratitude">A Quiet Kind of Gratitude</h3>

<p>That’s why I’m starting to feel something surprising:<br />
<strong>Gratitude for my loneliness.</strong></p>

<p>Because it’s <em>not here to break me</em>. It’s here to move me.<br />
To remind me that I <em>was never meant to stay comfortable in isolation.</em></p>

<p>Loneliness is not a flaw — it’s a flare.<br />
A message from my deeper self, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“You were made for something more.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the only way I’ll ever experience the kind of connection I long for — real, mutual, safe — is if I walk toward it. Sword in hand. Nervous system screaming. But still walking.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="not-just-willing--wanting">Not Just Willing — <em>Wanting</em></h3>

<p>I don’t want to just “be okay” on my own anymore.<br />
I <em>can</em> be — I’ve proven that.<br />
But I want more than okay.</p>

<p>I want to connect.<br />
To let people see me.<br />
To offer my love. To receive it.</p>

<p>And if I have to feel every ounce of emptiness first to get there — then so be it.<br />
I’ll feel it. I’ll sit with it. And then I’ll walk toward the light.</p>
