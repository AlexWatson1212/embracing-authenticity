It wasn’t about running hot, or hitting big hands at the right time. It was about <strong>holding my nerve</strong> when it mattered most — and that’s where the real growth lives.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-bubble-phase">The Bubble Phase</h3>

<p>I found myself hovering just above the danger zone, with a short stack, watching other players panic or overreach. At one point, I had to fold hands like <strong>Ace-Queen</strong>, <strong>Ace-Jack</strong>, and even <strong>Ace-King</strong> — hands that would normally be slam-dunk jams or calls.</p>

<p>But this wasn’t a normal spot.</p>

<p>This was the ICM bubble.</p>

<p>And <strong>one bad decision</strong> — one mistimed shove — would’ve meant going home with nothing.</p>

<p>So I waited.</p>

<p>I watched players with bigger stacks than mine throw their tournament lives away with reckless calls and wide shoves, and I reminded myself:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s not about how strong the hand is — it’s about how dangerous the spot is.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="cashing-through-patience">Cashing Through Patience</h3>

<p>Eventually, the short stacks busted. The money bubble burst. And I was still alive.</p>

<p>It might have looked passive from the outside, but every fold was a conscious, difficult choice. Every pause, a battle against ego.<br />
<strong>It’s not easy folding AK on a short stack.</strong><br />
It’s not easy trusting that survival — not action — is the most profitable move in that moment.</p>

<p>But I did. And it paid off.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-final-hand">The Final Hand</h3>

<p>With about 1.5 big blinds left, I picked up a playable hand. I flopped trip threes — a miracle — but got cracked by a straight on the river.</p>

<p>And I was okay with it.</p>

<p>Because I didn’t go out on tilt. I didn’t punt.<br />
I went out knowing I’d played the bubble <strong>exactly how I needed to</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="long-term-perspective">Long-Term Perspective</h3>

<p>This is where real tournament profit comes from.<br />
Not the flashy bluffs or the wild hero calls — but the quiet, gritty decisions in high-pressure moments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Folding good hands</li>
  <li>Watching others make mistakes</li>
  <li>Trusting that the math and timing are on your side</li>
</ul>

<p>It may not look dramatic. It may even seem boring.</p>

<p>But these are the hands — or non-hands — that <strong>build a winning career</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It may look straightforward, but holding your nerve in those situations is not as easy as it looks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was one of those days where I earned every chip.<br />
And that $200 cash? That’s just the start.</p>

That’s what this is.</p>

<p>Will I find true connection?<br />
Will I become a good therapist?<br />
Will I be a good enough father to my son?</p>

<p>These are the kinds of questions that don’t come with guarantees.<br />
And yet, somehow, I’m starting to believe the answers.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-think-i-will">I Think I Will</h3>

<p>I think I <em>will</em> be a good therapist.<br />
I think I <em>am</em> a good dad —<br />
even though I’ll never complete that role in full.<br />
It’s a job that lasts a lifetime, and one that doesn’t ask for perfection — only presence.</p>

<p>The uncertainty that lingers most is this:<br />
<strong>Will I ever have real, lasting connection?</strong></p>

<p>Not just the kind you pay for.<br />
Not just fleeting glimmers that vanish before they can root.<br />
But long-term, mutual, steady love.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-shame-of-wanting">The Shame of Wanting</h3>

<p>When I start to feel that need rise in me, there’s a part of me that wants to shove it back down.<br />
Because I’ve learned — painfully — that showing how much I <em>need</em> connection can push people away.</p>

<p>So I withhold.<br />
Not because I don’t feel it — but because I fear that feeling will make me too much, again.</p>

<p>But it’s not <em>my fault</em> I’m here.</p>

<p>I didn’t have the support I needed.<br />
I was gaslit by the people who should have nurtured me.<br />
Taught to distrust my own knowing.<br />
Made to feel responsible for my parents’ sadness, as if it were mine to fix.</p>

<p>That’s not a child’s burden.<br />
It never was.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-didnt-give-up">I Didn’t Give Up</h3>

<p>If I take a real look at the path behind me, it’s remarkable I’m still here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two stays in hospital.</li>
  <li>No addiction to numb the pain, even when the pain was loud.</li>
  <li>No running — not in the end.</li>
  <li>Just quiet, persistent walking through the fire.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could have lost myself.<br />
To weed. To porn. To food.<br />
To shame. To despair.</p>

<p>But I didn’t.<br />
I <em>chose</em> to keep showing up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-am-blossoming">I Am Blossoming</h3>

<p>No one gave me compassion for these things.<br />
In fact, many shamed me more when I revealed them.<br />
They made me feel <em>even more alone</em> in the moments I most needed to be seen.</p>

<p>So if no one else will give it to me — <em>I will</em>.</p>

<p>I am okay.<br />
I am lovable.<br />
And I love myself.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-i-know-now">What I Know Now</h3>

<p>I know that one day I’ll find beautiful people.<br />
People who love gently, and see me clearly.<br />
And I know that if I’m not quite there yet — in terms of health, regulation, ease —<br />
I can <em>get there</em>.</p>

<p>This path I’m walking — into therapy, into healing —<br />
It’s not just for others.<br />
It’s for me, too.</p>

<p>And I believe, truly, that when I’m around people who love me —<br />
<strong>I won’t just blossom. I’ll bloom.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Healing," /><category term="Self-Compassion," /><category term="Therapy," /><category term="Loneliness," /><category term="Uncertainty" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncertainty.

That deep, quiet feeling of <strong>emptiness</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s not loud. It doesn’t scream or demand anything from me.<br />
It’s just <em>there</em> — like a still fog resting over everything.<br />
Not sadness exactly, not numbness either.<br />
Just a hollow kind of space inside that whispers, <em>“Something’s missing.”</em></p>

<p>And I’ve noticed how quickly I try to fill it.</p>

<p>With noise.<br />
With tasks.<br />
With people.<br />
With food.<br />
With scrolling.<br />
With stories in my head about what’s wrong with me or what I need to fix.</p>

<p>But today, I didn’t try to fill it.<br />
I let it be there.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-space-thats-always-been-there">🌫️ A Space That’s Always Been There</h3>

<p>The truth is — this emptiness has always lived inside me.<br />
It comes from all the places love didn’t reach.<br />
From all the times I needed someone and no one came.<br />
From all the moments I swallowed my needs just to keep the peace.<br />
From all the pretending that I was okay when I wasn’t.</p>

<p>And in that emptiness, I sometimes feel lonely.<br />
Not just alone, but <em>lonely</em> in the truest sense — like no one really sees me.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-gift-of-not-turning-away">🪞 The Gift of Not Turning Away</h3>

<p>But there’s also something tender here.<br />
Because when I stop running from the emptiness, I can actually hear what it’s saying.</p>

<p>It doesn’t want to be filled.<br />
It wants to be <strong>witnessed</strong>.</p>

<p>Not fixed. Not explained. Not healed in a rush.</p>

<p>Just held.<br />
Gently.<br />
Without judgment.</p>

<p>And in that stillness, there’s a strange kind of peace.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-not-forever-just-for-now">🔁 Not Forever, Just For Now</h3>

<p>I know this isn’t forever.<br />
Emptiness is a visitor — not a life sentence.<br />
And sometimes what it’s really asking for is my own presence.</p>

<p>To sit with myself the way I wish someone had once sat with me.</p>

<p>No advice.<br />
No distraction.<br />
Just… <em>presence.</em></p>

<p>So today, I gave myself that.<br />
And it was enough.</p>

<p>Not everything needs to be filled.<br />
Some spaces are sacred —<br />
And maybe this one is where the real connection begins.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Loneliness" /><category term="Emotional Healing" /><category term="Self-Reflection" /><category term="Authenticity" /><category term="Connection" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately I’ve been sitting with something I usually try to avoid: That deep, quiet feeling of emptiness.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rewriting My Origin Story</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/rewriting-my-origin-story.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rewriting My Origin Story" /><published>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/rewriting-my-origin-story</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/rewriting-my-origin-story.html"><![CDATA[<p>When I reflect back on when I went manic, I think it was a steady, progressive realization of the lack of connection and the depth of my emptiness — despite being surrounded by people who were supposed to be my friends.</p>

<p>They didn’t respect me.<br />
They didn’t truly connect with me.</p>

<p>And the more I realized that, the more weed I smoked. I progressively became more manic — until eventually, I entered psychosis.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-illusion-that-kept-me-safe">The Illusion That Kept Me Safe</h3>

<p>It started with realizing my family never really saw me.<br />
That their love came with conditions — with expectations that I’d be someone else entirely.</p>

<p>I think my mind, desperate to cope, constructed a story where I was someone <em>important</em>.<br />
Someone <em>chosen</em>.<br />
Someone whose pain <em>meant something</em>.</p>

<p>In psychosis, I remember believing I had a spiritual purpose.<br />
That I was on a mission.<br />
That I had to go through this darkness because I was being prepared for something greater.</p>

<p>Looking back, that wasn’t madness.<br />
That was a survival response.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="my-brain-was-protecting-me">My Brain Was Protecting Me</h3>

<p>Psychosis didn’t mean I was broken.<br />
It meant the weight of truth — of betrayal, of abandonment, of emotional starvation — was too heavy for me to hold all at once.</p>

<p>So my brain tried to carry it for me.<br />
By turning trauma into mythology.<br />
By turning pain into purpose.</p>

<p>And in many ways, it worked.<br />
Because I survived.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="now-i-tell-the-truth">Now I Tell the Truth</h3>

<p>Today, I no longer need fantasy to make sense of what happened.</p>

<p>It hurt because it <em>should</em> have hurt.<br />
I felt alone because I <em>was</em> alone.<br />
And I broke because no one came to hold me when I needed it most.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean I’m unlovable.<br />
Or unworthy.<br />
Or broken beyond repair.</p>

<p>It means I’ve lived through something <em>real</em>.<br />
And I’m still here.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="im-rewriting-it-now">I’m Rewriting It Now</h3>

<p>This is what healing looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Naming what really happened.</li>
  <li>Honoring the ways I coped.</li>
  <li>Letting myself grieve the love I didn’t get.</li>
  <li>And writing a new story — not from delusion, but from truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not the chosen one.<br />
I’m just someone who never got what they needed.<br />
And I’m learning to give it to myself now.</p>

<p>That’s enough.</p>

<p>That’s everything.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Healing," /><category term="Trauma," /><category term="Mental" /><category term="Health," /><category term="Reflection," /><category term="Self-Compassion" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A raw reflection on psychosis, fantasy, and how my mind tried to protect me from the truth of abandonment.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Not Just the Cards</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/not-just-the-cards.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Not Just the Cards" /><published>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/not-just-the-cards</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/01/not-just-the-cards.html"><![CDATA[<p>Some days, it’s not just the hands I lose — it’s what they represent.</p>

<p>Today, I made the right moves. I played the math. I stayed disciplined. I kept showing up.<br />
And still… I lost.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sevens vs. Ace-Jack:</strong> flipped deep in a major — gone.</li>
  <li><strong>Nines vs. Jacks in a bounty builder turbo:</strong> over-shoved with 20 bigs, gone.</li>
  <li><strong>Bubble pressure hands:</strong> played smart, walked away empty.</li>
</ul>

<p>And it’s not that the individual hands were bad. They weren’t.<br />
It’s the <strong>accumulation</strong> that gets me.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-when-poker-feeds-the-inner-critic">🧠 When Poker Feeds the Inner Critic</h3>

<p>Some days, these losses just roll off.<br />
But today, they hit deeper.<br />
Today, they touched that place that still believes <em>“I’m not enough.”</em></p>

<p>And I know — rationally — that’s not true.<br />
But emotionally? After a day of grief, of sitting with the pain of not being held, of never really having my needs met… poker just <em>mirrored it back to me.</em></p>

<p>The randomness. The helplessness.<br />
The <strong>longing to be rewarded</strong> for doing things right — and still watching it fall apart.</p>

<p>That’s not about cards.<br />
That’s about life.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-weight-i-was-already-carrying">💔 The Weight I Was Already Carrying</h3>

<p>I’ve been sitting with the grief of never being held.<br />
Not properly. Not consistently.<br />
I’ve had to be my own comfort for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>And it’s exhausting.</p>

<p>So when the flips don’t go my way, it’s not just about the chips.<br />
It’s about everything they reflect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Even when I show up well… I don’t win.”</em><br />
<em>“Even when I try… it’s not enough.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not tilt. That’s trauma.</p>

<p>And I’m naming it, not to drown in it — but to move through it.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-and-then-i-hit-the-8">🎯 And Then I Hit the 8</h3>

<p>Later in the same tournament, I shoved <strong>Ace-9 off for seven bigs</strong> into a short-stacked UTG opener with a $20 bounty.<br />
He flipped over <strong>Aces.</strong> Of course he did.<br />
But somehow — <em>I hit a straight on the turn.</em> I won.</p>

<p>And then again — <strong>Ace-8 offsuit</strong>, I shoved for eight bigs.<br />
Called by <strong>Ace-5 suited</strong>. Then <strong>Ace-King suited</strong> behind that.<br />
And somehow — <em>I hit an 8.</em></p>

<p>I didn’t celebrate wildly. I didn’t feel redeemed.<br />
But I felt <em>something shift.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not everything goes against me.<br />
Not every hand ends in silence.<br />
Sometimes, I hit the 8.<br />
And that’s enough — for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-the-real-game-im-playing">🕊️ The Real Game I’m Playing</h3>

<p>I’m not just playing poker.<br />
I’m playing the long game of healing.<br />
The game of staying regulated when life (and variance) keeps saying <em>“Not yet.”</em></p>

<p>And I’m not broken because it gets to me.<br />
I’m not weak because I feel it more on some days.</p>

<p>I’m just someone who’s lost more than his fair share —<br />
But still keeps sitting down,<br />
Still keeps showing up,<br />
Still keeps hoping for the next card to fall in his favour.</p>

But I know I have to do it.</p>

<p>I thought connection would gently ease in as I healed. And maybe some of it has.<br />
There are sparks — people at college who I feel a sense of potential with.<br />
But I can’t rely on one environment to meet every emotional need I have.</p>

<p>And yet, I’m tired. My energy is limited.<br />
I’m trying to be mindful — not to force things, not to overextend, not to chase.</p>

<p>It’s not an excuse.<br />
It’s just where I am.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-things-ive-already-done">The Things I’ve Already Done</h3>

<p>I’ve stopped giving energy to places and people where connection was always out of reach.<br />
That took something. That’s a beginning.<br />
And in doing that, I’ve created a little more internal space —<br />
space where I’m more regulated, more open, more available.</p>

<p>But connection hasn’t landed yet in the way I imagined.<br />
And maybe that’s because it rarely does.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-im-longing-for">What I’m Longing For</h3>

<p>Yes, I think I want a relationship.<br />
But underneath that, what I’m really longing for is <strong>connection</strong>.</p>

<p>To be seen. To see someone.<br />
To feel safe. To feel wanted.<br />
To relax around another human being — not because I’m performing, but because I’m finally able to just <em>be</em>.</p>

<p>And maybe that starts with smaller things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good conversation at college.</li>
  <li>A shared moment with someone I barely know.</li>
  <li>A smile that lingers just a little longer than usual.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the footholds.<br />
And right now, I’m in the lonely middle — no longer starving for crumbs, but not yet sitting at the table.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="this-part-is-sacred-too">This Part is Sacred, Too</h3>

<p>It’s easy to think this stage is meaningless — the waiting, the middle, the quiet.<br />
But it’s not.</p>

<p>This is the part where I choose integrity over desperation.<br />
Where I walk the talk. Where I let the discomfort mature me instead of harden me.<br />
Where I remind myself that not being chosen by someone doesn’t mean I’ve failed. It just means I’m still on the way.</p>

<p>This is where I build the kind of foundation that can <em>hold</em> the love I long for — when it finally arrives.</p>

<p>And until then?</p>

<p>I’ll keep showing up.<br />
Not perfectly. Not always gracefully.<br />
But honestly.</p>

<p><strong>Because the lonely middle might just be the birthplace of something real.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Loneliness," /><category term="Self-Compassion," /><category term="Connection," /><category term="Vulnerability," /><category term="Relationships" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don’t know how to do it.

But… am I?</p>

<p>Am I truly open to connection?<br />
Am I <em>welcoming</em> people in — or am I quietly turning away when love starts to approach?</p>

<p>There’s a subtle kind of avoidance I’ve started to notice in myself.<br />
A subconscious flinch. A retreat into the familiar shelter of solitude, even while outwardly saying I want closeness.</p>

<p>So I asked myself honestly:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Do I really want connection? Or am I terrified of it?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the answer is: <strong>both.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-price-of-not-sitting-with-it">The Price of Not Sitting With It</h3>

<p>Here’s what I’ve realized:</p>

<p>If I don’t let myself feel the depth of this loneliness —<br />
If I keep numbing, distracting, softening it just enough to tolerate —<br />
Then I’ll never be desperate or courageous enough to seek what I truly need.</p>

<p>I’ll stay just comfortable enough in isolation.<br />
Safe, but disconnected.<br />
Alive, but not living.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="a-quiet-kind-of-gratitude">A Quiet Kind of Gratitude</h3>

<p>That’s why I’m starting to feel something surprising:<br />
<strong>Gratitude for my loneliness.</strong></p>

<p>Because it’s <em>not here to break me</em>. It’s here to move me.<br />
To remind me that I <em>was never meant to stay comfortable in isolation.</em></p>

<p>Loneliness is not a flaw — it’s a flare.<br />
A message from my deeper self, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“You were made for something more.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the only way I’ll ever experience the kind of connection I long for — real, mutual, safe — is if I walk toward it. Sword in hand. Nervous system screaming. But still walking.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="not-just-willing--wanting">Not Just Willing — <em>Wanting</em></h3>

<p>I don’t want to just “be okay” on my own anymore.<br />
I <em>can</em> be — I’ve proven that.<br />
But I want more than okay.</p>

<p>I want to connect.<br />
To let people see me.<br />
To offer my love. To receive it.</p>

<p>And if I have to feel every ounce of emptiness first to get there — then so be it.<br />
I’ll feel it. I’ll sit with it. And then I’ll walk toward the light.</p>

Around letting myself be seen. Around letting people know who I really am.</p>

<p>At first, I thought maybe it was just perfectionism. Or timing. Or not feeling “ready.”</p>

<p>But when I sit with it, it feels like something much older. Much deeper.</p>

<p>I think I’m afraid because some part of me still believes that if I show people who I truly am, they’ll leave.</p>

<p>And that fear didn’t come out of nowhere.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-the-original-abandonment">🌫️ The Original Abandonment</h3>

<p>When I look back, my mother never really loved me in the way I needed.<br />
She didn’t nurture me.<br />
She didn’t see me.<br />
She didn’t consider what I wanted, or who I was becoming.</p>

<p>And what’s even harder to admit — I think she liked it when I was desperate for her approval. Because in that space, <em>she held the power.</em> She could give or withhold love. And I would keep trying, keep bending, keep proving.</p>

<p>So now, as an adult, when I create something that reflects my deepest truth — my real self — it stirs up that old terror:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“What if no one wants this? What if they walk away?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the truth is…<br />
<strong>She already walked away.</strong><br />
Not physically, but emotionally — from the very beginning.</p>

<p>So I’m not really afraid of being abandoned again.<br />
I’m afraid of <em>reliving</em> what I already lived through.<br />
And that’s what makes this so hard.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-risk-of-being-seen">🧡 The Risk of Being Seen</h3>

<p>There’s something vulnerable about building a project like this — about showing people the real me. Because it’s not a performance. It’s not filtered through what I think others want to hear.</p>

<p>It’s <em>me.</em> Quietly, honestly, imperfectly… me.</p>

<p>And that’s what makes it both terrifying and sacred.</p>

<p>Because the fear isn’t just fear.<br />
It’s <em>grief.</em><br />
It’s the pain of never having been accepted when it mattered most.<br />
And the cautious hope that maybe this time, it could be different.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-truth-im-holding-onto">🕯️ A Truth I’m Holding Onto</h3>

<p>I already feel unseen by most people.<br />
So what is it I’m really afraid of losing?</p>

<p>Not everyone will get it.<br />
But the right people might.<br />
And they’ll only find me if I let myself be found.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean I need to shout or overshare or bare everything at once.<br />
It just means <em>not hiding.</em></p>

<p>And that’s a risk I want to take.<br />
Because the life I want — the connection I long for — doesn’t exist behind a mask.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-if-this-resonates">🌱 If This Resonates</h3>

<p>If you’ve felt this too — the fear of being seen, the resistance to sharing what matters — I just want to say:</p>

<p>You’re not alone.<br />
And the fact that you found your way to these words means that <em>your inner voice</em> is still alive.<br />
Still guiding you.<br />
Still hoping.</p>

<p>Let that be your sign.<br />
You’re not broken for being afraid.<br />
You’re just someone who’s learning to be seen — maybe for the first time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Inner" /><category term="Child," /><category term="Fear" /><category term="of" /><category term="Rejection," /><category term="Authenticity," /><category term="Mother" /><category term="Wound," /><category term="Self-Expression" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fear of being seen runs deep when love once depended on hiding.

Not loud. Not performative. Just <em>there.</em> A kind of simple, steady companionship.</p>

<p>And I felt it — envy.<br />
Not the bitter kind.<br />
Not the kind that says, <em>“They shouldn’t have that.”</em><br />
But the kind that quietly whispers, <em>“I want that too.”</em></p>

<p>It wasn’t about the display — it was about what it represented:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Acceptance. Presence. Being chosen, without needing to be earned.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as I kept walking, something else rose up. A kind of ache.<br />
Not just from the man in me — but from the <em>boy.</em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-big-boys-dont-cry">🌫️ “Big Boys Don’t Cry”</h3>

<p>That old script came up almost automatically.</p>

<p>Even now, after all the healing, part of me still wants to explain away my emotion. To clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“These aren’t deep, uncontrollable sobs. Just a silent weep. Nothing dramatic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I know what that is — it’s my ego, still trying to protect the boy from being shamed.</p>

<p>The truth is:<br />
These tears weren’t weakness.<br />
They were <em>release.</em><br />
A soft grieving for the love I never got.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-the-boy-who-wasnt-allowed-to-feel">👦 The Boy Who Wasn’t Allowed to Feel</h3>

<p>It’s not that I’ve never cried. I’ve cried on runs. In therapy. In quiet moments at home.<br />
But lately, I’ve realized — it’s not always <em>me</em> crying.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it’s the younger part of me — the boy who wasn’t held.<br />
The one who had to grow up too soon.<br />
The one who thought that staying quiet, staying small, staying strong would somehow keep him safe.</p>

<p>And now, when tears come, I don’t just feel sadness.<br />
I feel <em>recognition.</em><br />
Like something buried is finally being witnessed.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-different-kind-of-strength">🕊️ A Different Kind of Strength</h3>

<p>I don’t want to be the kind of man who holds everything in.<br />
I don’t want to be admired for how much I can carry without breaking.<br />
I want to be real — even when it’s raw. Even when it’s tender.</p>

<p>Because that boy in me never stopped needing love.<br />
He just stopped expecting it.</p>

<p>And now, when I cry, I’m not ashamed.<br />
I’m proud.</p>

<p>Because it means he’s still here.<br />
Still feeling.<br />
Still hoping.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s what healing really is:</p>

  <p>Letting the boy finally cry —<br />
and letting the man finally listen.</p>

<p>Not fame. Not praise. Just the quiet exposure of being truly seen — as I am, unfinished and imperfect.</p>

<p>The fear says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What if they mock you?<br />
What if they misunderstand you?<br />
What if you’re not good enough to help anyone?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here’s what I’ve realized:</p>

<p>I’ve <em>already</em> been judged, rejected, and disrespected — even when I was silent. Even when I hid.</p>

<p>So if I’ve paid that price anyway…<br />
why not <strong>step out</strong> and risk doing some good?</p>

<hr />

<p>There were times in my life — long, dark stretches — where suicide felt like the only option.<br />
When connection seemed impossible.<br />
When shame wrapped so tightly around me I couldn’t breathe.</p>

<p>And in those moments, I didn’t need a perfect mentor.<br />
I didn’t need a 10-step recovery plan.</p>

<p>I just needed a <strong>glimmer</strong>.<br />
A flicker of proof that someone like me could survive.<br />
That maybe I wasn’t beyond repair.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s why I write.</p>

<p>Not to be impressive.<br />
Not to be liked.<br />
But because if one person finds even the smallest light in what I share — one person lost in the dark, quietly holding on — then <strong>every ounce of fear becomes irrelevant</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t write for approval.<br />
I write because I believe in something bigger than fear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The power of honesty.<br />
The quiet strength in showing up.<br />
The healing that comes when one person dares to speak their truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>So when fear whispers,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re exposing too much,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remind myself:</p>

<p>I’m doing this for the version of me who had no one.</p>

<p>And maybe, just maybe, for someone else who needs that glimmer now.</p>

<p>If even one hurting soul feels less alone,<br />
then it’s all worth it.</p>

<p>Because I’m not hiding anymore.</p>

<p>This is who I am.</p>

<p>And I’m standing in it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If even one person finds a glimmer of hope in my words, then the fear of exposure becomes irrelevant. This is why I’ll keep showing up.]]></summary></entry></feed>
