Not loudly — but quietly. Like an old bruise that flinches when pressed.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel them when I’m alone.<br />
Sometimes in the presence of people who are kind but distant.<br />
And sometimes they sneak up on me in the form of jealousy, resentment, fantasy, or deep fatigue.</p>

<p>They’re unmet needs.<br />
Not because I’m needy. But because I’m human.</p>

<p>And instead of trying to get rid of them or rationalise them away, I’m starting to ask a different question:</p>

<p><strong>What if I could sit with them?</strong></p>

<p>What if I could let the ache be felt, without having to fix it?<br />
What if I could hold it like I would a child — mine — who just needs to be heard?</p>

<p>No silencing.<br />
No rushing.<br />
No “you should be over this by now.”</p>

<p>Just presence.</p>

<p>Because unmet needs don’t disappear when ignored. They morph. They disguise themselves as perfectionism, addictions, people-pleasing, isolation.<br />
But when met with compassion — when seen — they begin to soften.<br />
And sometimes, they begin to speak.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I wanted to be protected.”<br />
“I wanted to be chosen.”<br />
“I wanted to matter.”<br />
“I wanted someone to notice when I was hurting.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re not asking for magic. They’re asking for <em>you</em>.<br />
Your adult self. The part of you that knows better now. The part that’s slowly learning how to reparent the one who was once left alone with too much pain and too little support.</p>

<p>And you don’t have to solve it all at once.<br />
You just have to stay.</p>

<p>Sit with the need.<br />
Let it breathe.<br />
Let it exist.<br />
Let it know it doesn’t have to scream anymore to be heard.</p>

<p>Because when you stop abandoning your own unmet needs, the world becomes a safer place — not because it’s changed, but because <em>you</em> have.</p>

You are not too much — you were just too alone.</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Inner" /><category term="Child," /><category term="Healing," /><category term="Shame," /><category term="Self-Parenting," /><category term="Emotional" /><category term="Growth" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning to hold space for the parts of us that never got what they needed — without trying to fix or shame them.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Safety of the Unavailable</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/04/the-safety-of-the-unavailable.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Safety of the Unavailable" /><published>2025-06-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/04/the-safety-of-the-unavailable</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/04/the-safety-of-the-unavailable.html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s something oddly comforting about women who are unavailable.</p>

<p>Maybe they’re married. Maybe they’re distant. Maybe they’ve made it clear — they’re not interested.<br />
And yet, somehow, that’s where I’ve felt most able to be… me.</p>

<p>Because there’s no risk of intimacy when intimacy is off the table.<br />
No threat of being fully seen, only to be fully rejected.<br />
No possibility of things going somewhere, which means no chance of them falling apart.</p>

<p>That’s not manipulative. That’s a nervous system seeking safety.</p>

<p>And it’s only now that I’m starting to understand it — not judge it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’ve felt attraction to women I can’t have, and I’ve also felt shame about it.<br />
But when I sit with that shame — when I ask what’s really underneath — I don’t find bad intentions.<br />
I find unmet needs.</p>

<p>A desire to feel wanted.<br />
A longing to be seen, but only from a safe distance.<br />
A craving for connection without the risk of abandonment.</p>

<hr />

<p>There’s a younger part of me in all of this.<br />
The boy who grew up being hurt by closeness.<br />
The one who learned that love wasn’t safe, and that wanting something — especially someone — often led to pain.</p>

<p>That part of me doesn’t need to be fixed.<br />
He needs to be listened to.<br />
He needs to know he’s not dirty or shameful for wanting to feel something, even if it’s been misdirected.</p>

<hr />

<p>I want to change this pattern — not because desiring someone is wrong — but because I want to stop running from real intimacy.<br />
I want to desire women who can meet me where I’m at.<br />
I want to be seen — not just glimpsed from afar.</p>

<p>And maybe the first step is letting myself be seen… by me.</p>

<p>Even in the places that feel a bit messy.<br />
Even in the places where shame whispers that I’m too much.</p>

<p>Maybe especially there.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Healing," /><category term="Desire," /><category term="Vulnerability," /><category term="Shame," /><category term="Relationships" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring why I feel safer around unavailable women, and what that says about the intimacy I fear and the connection I crave.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Longing to Be Desired</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/04/the-longing-to-be-desired.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Longing to Be Desired" /><published>2025-06-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/04/the-longing-to-be-desired</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/04/the-longing-to-be-desired.html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s a part of me I don’t often talk about.</p>

<p>The part that longs to be desired — not just liked, not just accepted — but <em>truly wanted</em>. The kind of desire that doesn’t just tolerate your presence but lights up at the sight of you. That leans in. That lingers.</p>

<p>For a long time, I told myself I didn’t need that. That I was above it, or beyond it, or better off without it. But that wasn’t the truth. That was the survival story I had to write when I wasn’t being mirrored back as worthy. When desire felt unsafe. When I associated wanting with rejection.</p>

<p>So I suppressed it.<br />
And in its place, I became “nice.”<br />
I became “safe.”<br />
I became someone who could never be rejected — but also, someone who rarely got to be fully seen.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve started to realise that this part of me — the part that wants to feel <em>wanted</em> — isn’t weak. It’s not shameful. It’s not manipulative or selfish.<br />
It’s sacred.</p>

<p>It’s the part of me that still believes intimacy could be mutual. That someone could see me — <em>truly</em> see me — and not flinch. That desire could exist without danger. That I wouldn’t be abandoned for being too much, or shamed for being vulnerable, or punished for being real.</p>

<p>That feels like healing.</p>

<p>And yes, it’s scary.<br />
Yes, I still feel the echoes of old wounds.<br />
But I’m starting to notice: the more I allow myself to feel that desire — without judgment — the more human I feel. The more whole I feel.</p>

<p>This isn’t about rushing into connection. It’s not about needing someone to fill a gap. It’s about reclaiming a part of myself I once buried to survive.</p>

<p>I want to be desired.<br />
And that’s okay.</p>

<p>Maybe you do too.<br />
And maybe it’s time we stop pretending otherwise.</p>

<p>When I want something, when I feel drawn toward something that feels deeply <em>me</em>, I don’t allow myself to simply want it. I don’t allow myself to say, <em>“I’m doing this because I want to.”</em></p>

<p>Instead, I justify it through someone else.</p>

<p>I said I was buying that car to help my mum.<br />
But really? I wanted it for myself.</p>

<p>I said I was building this website for my son.<br />
But really? It’s for me — to finally express myself, to be seen, even if only by me at first.</p>

<p>It feels almost wrong to admit that. Like I’ve broken some unspoken rule about needing to be useful, selfless, productive. But the truth is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It was always for me. I just didn’t know I was allowed to say that.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a long time, I couldn’t. I had to filter everything I did through someone else’s benefit — because I was never taught that my desires were valid on their own.</p>

<p>But now I’m realizing something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wanting something for <em>me</em> isn’t selfish — it’s <em>self-honoring</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the irony is, even when I do it for myself, it still ripples outward.<br />
My son learns by watching.<br />
My inner child learns by being listened to.<br />
My life takes shape not through performance, but through <strong>truth</strong>.</p>

<p>So this website? This car? These quiet decisions I’ve made that I used to hide behind excuses?</p>

<p>They’re mine.</p>

<p>And I’m learning that <strong>they’re allowed to be</strong>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Authenticity," /><category term="Healing," /><category term="Self-Worth," /><category term="Inner" /><category term="Child," /><category term="Expression" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A reflection on how I used to justify my desires through others, and what it means to finally claim what I want for myself — without apology.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Day I Started Seeing Myself</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/the-day-i-started-seeing-myself.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Day I Started Seeing Myself" /><published>2025-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/the-day-i-started-seeing-myself</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/the-day-i-started-seeing-myself.html"><![CDATA[<p>Alexander Watson <a href="mailto:alexanderclivewatson@gmail.com">alexanderclivewatson@gmail.com</a>

description: A quiet, powerful reflection on parenting, emotional exhaustion, and what it really means to be a good enough father.
—</p>

<p>Today I learned a lot about myself. Not by solving anything. Not by pushing through. But by finally sitting still long enough to hear the truth I’ve been avoiding:</p>

<p>I’m exhausted — spiritually, emotionally, physically.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s not because I’ve done too little, but because I’ve carried too much. For too long. Alone.</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize that I don’t give myself credit — not for how far I’ve come, not for the father I am, not for the way I hold it all together. My parents set the bar so low emotionally that I don’t even feel proud when I do better. It’s like I unconsciously replaced “better than them” with “I must be perfect,” and that’s left me always feeling like I’m failing.</p>

<p>But today, something shifted.<br />
My son broke a curtain rail.<br />
Then he knocked over a glass of water near the electrics.<br />
And I felt frustrated.<br />
But I didn’t explode.<br />
I didn’t shut down.<br />
I stayed.</p>

<p>And even though part of me wanted to disconnect, I explained how I felt. I let him see me — not as a perfect parent, but as a <strong>human</strong>. I didn’t abandon him. I didn’t abandon myself. And in that moment, I realized something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I’m a good enough father.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have qualities I would have killed for in a father. I listen. I explain. I take space for myself, and I invite my son into that space with honesty. I give him what I never had.</p>

<p>Later, when I noticed myself overeating cake and my body battery dropping to 24, I almost spiraled. But then I realized: I wasn’t failing. My body was simply showing me that today, it felt safe enough to let things rise. The emotional weight I’ve been carrying for years finally had room to breathe.</p>

<p>Maybe this was the right time to finally express my authentic self to my son.<br />
Maybe I’m learning to listen to what my body wants.<br />
Maybe — for the first time — I’m being truly respectful to myself.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s enough.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alexander Watson alexanderclivewatson@gmail.com 8:13 PM (2 hours ago) to me]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maybe This Website Is Me Trying to Be Seen</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/maybe-this-website-is-me-trying-to-be-seen.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maybe This Website Is Me Trying to Be Seen" /><published>2025-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/maybe-this-website-is-me-trying-to-be-seen</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/03/maybe-this-website-is-me-trying-to-be-seen.html"><![CDATA[<p>Maybe this website is a way of healing myself.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s not about building something “impressive” or useful to others — maybe it’s about finally expressing who I really am. And if anyone were to read it, they wouldn’t be seeing a curated version of me. They’d be seeing the <em>real</em> parts — the ones I’ve kept hidden, the ones I’ve struggled to reveal, even to myself.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s why there’s so much resistance in sharing it.</p>

<p>Because I’ve never truly been seen and accepted before. Not as I am. Maybe I’ve experienced glimmers of it — with therapists, maybe with a few friends at college — but even then, I’m not sure I let myself <em>fully</em> be known.</p>

<p>It’s possible I’ve been protecting myself by only letting people see the parts that feel safe to show. It’s possible that some deeper parts still haven’t surfaced yet — and maybe those parts hold the key to healing the ache I’ve always carried.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m closer than I think.<br />
Or maybe I’m further than I want to believe.<br />
Maybe both are true.</p>

<p>But maybe I don’t need to know where I am on the map.<br />
Maybe the work is simply in sitting with what’s here.<br />
Maybe there is no path, and <em>that’s the path</em>.<br />
And maybe, if I choose to keep sitting with it — this uncertainty, this need, this tenderness — I’ll find my way back to myself.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s enough for now.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Self-Discovery," /><category term="Healing," /><category term="Vulnerability," /><category term="Authenticity," /><category term="Expression" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quiet reflection on why creating this website might be more than a project — it might be an act of healing, of finally allowing myself to be seen.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Earning It on the Bubble</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/02/earning-it-on-the-bubble.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Earning It on the Bubble" /><published>2025-06-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-06-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/02/earning-it-on-the-bubble</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/02/earning-it-on-the-bubble.html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I cashed for $200 in a bounty tournament, and while it might not sound like much, I’m honestly proud of how I played. It wasn’t about running hot, or hitting big hands at the right time. It was about <strong>holding my nerve</strong> when it mattered most — and that’s where the real growth lives.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-bubble-phase">The Bubble Phase</h3>

<p>I found myself hovering just above the danger zone, with a short stack, watching other players panic or overreach. At one point, I had to fold hands like <strong>Ace-Queen</strong>, <strong>Ace-Jack</strong>, and even <strong>Ace-King</strong> — hands that would normally be slam-dunk jams or calls.</p>

<p>But this wasn’t a normal spot.</p>

<p>This was the ICM bubble.</p>

<p>And <strong>one bad decision</strong> — one mistimed shove — would’ve meant going home with nothing.</p>

<p>So I waited.</p>

<p>I watched players with bigger stacks than mine throw their tournament lives away with reckless calls and wide shoves, and I reminded myself:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s not about how strong the hand is — it’s about how dangerous the spot is.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="cashing-through-patience">Cashing Through Patience</h3>

<p>Eventually, the short stacks busted. The money bubble burst. And I was still alive.</p>

<p>It might have looked passive from the outside, but every fold was a conscious, difficult choice. Every pause, a battle against ego.<br />
<strong>It’s not easy folding AK on a short stack.</strong><br />
It’s not easy trusting that survival — not action — is the most profitable move in that moment.</p>

<p>But I did. And it paid off.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-final-hand">The Final Hand</h3>

<p>With about 1.5 big blinds left, I picked up a playable hand. I flopped trip threes — a miracle — but got cracked by a straight on the river.</p>

<p>And I was okay with it.</p>

<p>Because I didn’t go out on tilt. I didn’t punt.<br />
I went out knowing I’d played the bubble <strong>exactly how I needed to</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="long-term-perspective">Long-Term Perspective</h3>

<p>This is where real tournament profit comes from.<br />
Not the flashy bluffs or the wild hero calls — but the quiet, gritty decisions in high-pressure moments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Folding good hands</li>
  <li>Watching others make mistakes</li>
  <li>Trusting that the math and timing are on your side</li>
</ul>

<p>It may not look dramatic. It may even seem boring.</p>

<p>But these are the hands — or non-hands — that <strong>build a winning career</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It may look straightforward, but holding your nerve in those situations is not as easy as it looks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was one of those days where I earned every chip.<br />
And that $200 cash? That’s just the start.</p>

That’s what this is.</p>

<p>Will I find true connection?<br />
Will I become a good therapist?<br />
Will I be a good enough father to my son?</p>

<p>These are the kinds of questions that don’t come with guarantees.<br />
And yet, somehow, I’m starting to believe the answers.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-think-i-will">I Think I Will</h3>

<p>I think I <em>will</em> be a good therapist.<br />
I think I <em>am</em> a good dad —<br />
even though I’ll never complete that role in full.<br />
It’s a job that lasts a lifetime, and one that doesn’t ask for perfection — only presence.</p>

<p>The uncertainty that lingers most is this:<br />
<strong>Will I ever have real, lasting connection?</strong></p>

<p>Not just the kind you pay for.<br />
Not just fleeting glimmers that vanish before they can root.<br />
But long-term, mutual, steady love.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-shame-of-wanting">The Shame of Wanting</h3>

<p>When I start to feel that need rise in me, there’s a part of me that wants to shove it back down.<br />
Because I’ve learned — painfully — that showing how much I <em>need</em> connection can push people away.</p>

<p>So I withhold.<br />
Not because I don’t feel it — but because I fear that feeling will make me too much, again.</p>

<p>But it’s not <em>my fault</em> I’m here.</p>

<p>I didn’t have the support I needed.<br />
I was gaslit by the people who should have nurtured me.<br />
Taught to distrust my own knowing.<br />
Made to feel responsible for my parents’ sadness, as if it were mine to fix.</p>

<p>That’s not a child’s burden.<br />
It never was.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-didnt-give-up">I Didn’t Give Up</h3>

<p>If I take a real look at the path behind me, it’s remarkable I’m still here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two stays in hospital.</li>
  <li>No addiction to numb the pain, even when the pain was loud.</li>
  <li>No running — not in the end.</li>
  <li>Just quiet, persistent walking through the fire.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could have lost myself.<br />
To weed. To porn. To food.<br />
To shame. To despair.</p>

<p>But I didn’t.<br />
I <em>chose</em> to keep showing up.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="i-am-blossoming">I Am Blossoming</h3>

<p>No one gave me compassion for these things.<br />
In fact, many shamed me more when I revealed them.<br />
They made me feel <em>even more alone</em> in the moments I most needed to be seen.</p>

<p>So if no one else will give it to me — <em>I will</em>.</p>

<p>I am okay.<br />
I am lovable.<br />
And I love myself.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-i-know-now">What I Know Now</h3>

<p>I know that one day I’ll find beautiful people.<br />
People who love gently, and see me clearly.<br />
And I know that if I’m not quite there yet — in terms of health, regulation, ease —<br />
I can <em>get there</em>.</p>

<p>This path I’m walking — into therapy, into healing —<br />
It’s not just for others.<br />
It’s for me, too.</p>

<p>And I believe, truly, that when I’m around people who love me —<br />

That deep, quiet feeling of <strong>emptiness</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s not loud. It doesn’t scream or demand anything from me.<br />
It’s just <em>there</em> — like a still fog resting over everything.<br />
Not sadness exactly, not numbness either.<br />
Just a hollow kind of space inside that whispers, <em>“Something’s missing.”</em></p>

<p>And I’ve noticed how quickly I try to fill it.</p>

<p>With noise.<br />
With tasks.<br />
With people.<br />
With food.<br />
With scrolling.<br />
With stories in my head about what’s wrong with me or what I need to fix.</p>

<p>But today, I didn’t try to fill it.<br />
I let it be there.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="️-a-space-thats-always-been-there">🌫️ A Space That’s Always Been There</h3>

<p>The truth is — this emptiness has always lived inside me.<br />
It comes from all the places love didn’t reach.<br />
From all the times I needed someone and no one came.<br />
From all the moments I swallowed my needs just to keep the peace.<br />
From all the pretending that I was okay when I wasn’t.</p>

<p>And in that emptiness, I sometimes feel lonely.<br />
Not just alone, but <em>lonely</em> in the truest sense — like no one really sees me.</p>

<hr />

<p>But there’s also something tender here.<br />
Because when I stop running from the emptiness, I can actually hear what it’s saying.</p>

<p>It doesn’t want to be filled.<br />
It wants to be <strong>witnessed</strong>.</p>

<p>Not fixed. Not explained. Not healed in a rush.</p>

<p>Just held.<br />
Gently.<br />
Without judgment.</p>

<p>And in that stillness, there’s a strange kind of peace.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="-not-forever-just-for-now">🔁 Not Forever, Just For Now</h3>

<p>I know this isn’t forever.<br />
Emptiness is a visitor — not a life sentence.<br />
And sometimes what it’s really asking for is my own presence.</p>

<p>To sit with myself the way I wish someone had once sat with me.</p>

<p>No advice.<br />
No distraction.<br />
Just… <em>presence.</em></p>

<p>So today, I gave myself that.<br />
And it was enough.</p>

<p>Not everything needs to be filled.<br />
Some spaces are sacred —<br />
And maybe this one is where the real connection begins.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Loneliness" /><category term="Emotional Healing" /><category term="Self-Reflection" /><category term="Authenticity" /><category term="Connection" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately I’ve been sitting with something I usually try to avoid: That deep, quiet feeling of emptiness.]]></summary></entry></feed>
