I’ve realised something recently that feels both simple and profound: **I don’t want casual sex.** I don’t want fast sex. I don’t want emotionally disconnected sex.

I want **deep, slow intimacy** with one woman at a time.

This isn’t about being cautious or overly respectful. It’s not about fear or morality. It’s about *alignment* — with my nervous system, with my values, and with the way I naturally connect.

## It’s Not Sex I Want — It’s Connection That Expresses Itself Through Sex

There’s a difference between sex for stimulation, sex for validation, and sex as escape — versus sex that emerges from emotional closeness. Everything in me is wired for the latter.

Slow intimacy requires:

- trust  
- presence  
- emotional safety  
- patience  
- attunement  
- vulnerability  

My body doesn’t open in that way with multiple women at once. Dividing myself emotionally shuts me down. Depth only comes through **one connection at a time**.

## Emotional Attachment Makes Intimacy Enjoyable

For me, sex isn’t meaningful without attachment. Not clingy attachment — just the basic emotional connection that lets my body relax and be present.

True slow intimacy needs:

- softness  
- trust  
- slowness  
- co-regulation  

And my body doesn’t find that in casual dynamics.

## My Values Are Actually Very Simple

What I want aligns with who I am:

- I don’t want to mislead anyone.  
- I don’t want to waste someone’s time.  
- I want depth instead of options.  
- I want connection rather than chaos.  
- I want sex that means something.

It turns out I’m not “too careful.”  
I’m simply **not interested in shallow experiences**.

## I Want the Kind of Intimacy Where I Can Be Fully Present

The kind where I can:

- slow down  
- feel into the moment  
- stay connected  
- not perform  
- not protect myself  
- be grounded  
- be emotionally open  
- explore gently  

This is the sex of someone who’s healed enough to feel — the kind that comes from connection, not avoidance.

## I’m Ready For It

And I think that’s why this desire feels so clear. I’m not resisting anything. I’m not trying to be moral. I’m just listening to what my body, heart, and values all agree on:

**I want deep, slow intimacy with a woman I actually feel connected to.**  
One connection at a time.  
Depth over breadth.  
Presence over performance.

When the right connection appears, I know this experience will unfold naturally.

It’s not about doing more.  
It’s about letting myself be met.
