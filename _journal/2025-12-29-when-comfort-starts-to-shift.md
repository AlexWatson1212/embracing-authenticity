A short, living observation — not fully formed, but moving.

## What I’m Noticing

Tonight, I went for a gentle jog through the park.  
Nothing big — just a mile.

But it’s the most I’ve done in a while,  
and that feels like something worth noticing.

My mind felt clearer as I moved.  
I wasn’t trying to solve anything — which is unusual for me.  
Usually there’s a background urgency… a puzzle to fix.

But outside, it felt like things were being processed  
without needing my control.

For so long, food, cigars, even massages  
have been comfort — survival, really.  
They stepped in where connection was missing.

Those weren’t failures.  
They were what helped me stay alive  
when I had to get through everything *alone*.

And now…

I’m getting a glimpse of comfort that comes from another human:  
the kind that softens the nervous system  
instead of spiking it.

With even a little of that…  
I can feel something shifting.

My body wants healthier things.  
My home wants to become grounding.  
I want to treat myself well — not in fantasy, but in reality.

It feels like a new rhythm is forming:

From survival → into support → into connection → into growth.

## Why I Think It Matters

My coping mechanisms were loyal companions.  
I don’t resent them.

But I can sense I won’t always need them.

Security is slowly replacing scarcity.  
Presence is replacing panic.  
Comfort is becoming relational — not consumable.

What’s happening now is revealing a simple truth:

**Life was incredibly hard without connection.**

And now…  
it’s beginning to feel possible.

## The Open Question

What if healing isn’t about removing old comforts…

but gently outgrowing the need for them  
as new ones enter my life?

> I’m still figuring this out…
