Over the past few days, something subtle has become much clearer to me: certain people in my counselling group trigger an irritation in me that’s almost disproportionate to the moment. It’s not explosive, and it’s not reactive. It’s more like a tightening in my chest — a quiet *“here we go again”* that I’ve come to recognise.

What sets it off isn’t anything dramatic. It’s tiny, anxious directives:

- *“Alex, move your bag.”*  
- *“Alex, sit here.”*  
- *“Alex, do this.”*

On the surface, these people are harmless. Genuinely harmless. But their energy feels familiar — and not in a comforting way. It reminds me of the anxious micro-control I grew up with. The constant managing, organising, and subtly policing of my behaviour. As a child, I didn’t have the option to step away from it. As an adult, I do.

And that’s where the irritation comes from: it’s my boundary, not my wound.

## The Mother Template

I’ve realised that my system recognises this particular flavour of interaction instantly. These women aren’t my mum, and their behaviour is nowhere near as intense, but they carry shades of the same relational template:

- anxious beneath the surface  
- overly responsible for the atmosphere  
- subtly directing others to manage their own discomfort  
- unaware of the impact it has  

It’s not personal. It’s not malicious. It’s simply how they regulate themselves. But my body remembers a time when this kind of energy meant I didn’t have any space to be myself.

Now I do — and that’s why it irritates me.  
It’s the adult in me saying, *“No, thank you.”*

## Why I Can’t Go Deeper With Them

What I’m realising is that people who operate from this anxious-controlling place rarely reveal their real selves. They’re too busy managing the room, the group, or the imagined reactions of others. I could try to reach deeper, but I won’t get anywhere — because the authentic person is hidden underneath layers of control and fear.

And honestly?  
**That’s not my work. Not anymore.**

For years, I tried to wake people like this up. To show them I could see through it. To nudge them toward awareness. But recently I’ve realised something uncomfortable and true:

I wasn’t trying to wake *them* up.  
I was trying to wake *my parents* up.

## The Loneliness of Growing Secure

There’s also a loneliness in being more aware. Not a painful loneliness — more of a quiet, steady recognition that fewer people can meet me where I naturally sit.

But the truth is, there *are* people who can.  
People like Philippa, whose energy is light, funny, and grounded. People who don’t need to manage me to feel safe. People who show up as themselves without directing the room.

These are the people I want to invest in.

And the others? I don’t need to fix or resist them.  
I can simply let them be who they are, while keeping my boundary intact.

## The Evolution

This used to feel like conflict.  
Now it feels like clarity.

When someone says, *“Alex, sit here,”* I can feel the old irritation rise — but now it’s information, not entanglement. A signal that says:

- *This dynamic isn’t for me.*  
- *I don’t need to follow it.*  
- *I don’t need to fight it.*  
- *I can just step aside.*  

That’s adulthood.  
That’s the shift.  
That’s what security actually looks like in practice.

And the more I honour these signals, the more space I create for the relationships that nourish me — the ones built on authenticity, mutual ease, and real connection.
