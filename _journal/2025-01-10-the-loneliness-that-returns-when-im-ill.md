When I get ill, everything I’ve worked so hard to build in myself suddenly feels more fragile.

It’s strange how quickly the ground shifts. One day I can feel connected, confident, even hopeful about the direction my life is moving in. I can walk into college, sit beside people I like, and feel that soft, natural belonging I’ve wanted for most of my life. I can laugh, settle into myself, and feel part of something.  

And then I get sick, and it all drains out of me.

Being ill sends me back into a much older emotional world — a world where nobody came when I needed help, where I learned to handle everything alone, where vulnerability meant exposure, not care. It’s the world my body still remembers, even if my adult mind tries to push forward.

What comes up, every time, is this overwhelming sense of being *completely alone*.  
Not just practically alone.  
Emotionally alone, in a way that feels ancient.

And once that hits, I start looking outward for comfort in ways I don’t even recognise at first.  
I reach out to the college group chat hoping someone will respond.  
I keep talking to someone from Hinge, not because I feel a strong connection, but because she reminds me that I exist in other people’s worlds.  
I start noticing every gap in my life, every empty room, every missing piece of belonging.

It’s not that I’m needy. It’s that my younger self — the part of me who never had consistent, safe care — panics when my body weakens.  
He still believes no one is coming.

And in a way, he’s right. There isn’t anyone who shows up for me in that traditional “family” sense.  
Not my mother, who turned everything I shared into gossip.  
Not my sister, despite a lifetime of trying.  
Not anyone I could reliably call and say, “I feel rubbish, can you sit with me for a minute?”

So when illness strips everything down, it exposes the gap I usually manage to live around.

But this time, something unexpected happened.

I spoke to that younger version of myself.  
Really spoke to him.

I placed a hand on my chest and said:

> *“Alex, I’m with you.  
> We’re not alone like we were in childhood.  
> I know you want connection — I do too.  
> And I am doing everything I reasonably can to build a life where we have that.  
> You just need to trust me through this.  
> It will feel lonely.  
> But we’re not completely alone.  
> I’m here.  
> And I love you.”*

Saying that grounded me in a way I didn’t expect.  
It soothed him.  
And somehow, it soothed me too.

Because the truth is, at college, I *wasn’t* alone.

My adult self walked in calmly, sat beside someone safe, opened gentle conversation, and created space for connection.  
My inner child sat in the experience — delighted, open, drinking in the belonging he’s been starved of for decades.

That longing he feels now isn’t a sign of failure.  
It’s a sign that he’s finally alive in those moments.

The loneliness that appears when I’m ill is simply the contrast:  
the absence of that warm, natural connection he has begun to taste.

And that hurts.

It hurts honestly.  
It hurts rightly.  
It hurts because he’s human.

The adult in me can see the bigger picture:  
I am building something real.  
Slowly.  
Patiently.  
Through everyday interactions and grounded presence.

And while I can’t give him constant connection — not yet — I *can* show him that I’m here, that I’m steady, that I’m not abandoning him the way others did.

It’s not the glamorous side of healing, but it’s the real side:

Loneliness flares.  
Old wounds open.  
The inner child asks, “Where is everyone?”  
The adult answers, “I’m here.”

And for now, that is enough to carry us through the harder days —  
until the life I’m building catches up with the man I’m becoming.
