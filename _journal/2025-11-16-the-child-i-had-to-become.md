# The Child I Had to Become  
### Survival Roles, Attachment Wounds & Emotional Hypervigilance

Growing up in my house required me to become someone I wasn’t.

Not out of choice.  
Not out of personality.  
But out of emotional necessity.

Children in chaotic systems don’t ask,  
*“Who am I?”*  
They ask:

**“Who do I need to be to stay safe?”**

Only now, with distance and real clarity, am I starting to understand the roles I stepped into — not because they were healthy, but because they were required.

## **1. The Good Child**  
I learned very early that the easiest way to avoid chaos was to be:

- compliant  
- quiet  
- undemanding  
- emotionally self-contained  
- responsible beyond my years  

In a house with a dysregulated father and a controlling mother, the safest place was to not be a problem.

This became:

- people-pleasing  
- self-suppression  
- perfectionism  
- avoiding conflict  
- feeling guilty for saying no  

I didn’t “choose” that.  
It was survival.

## **2. The Emotional Translator**

I lived in a house where emotions were:

- denied  
- projected  
- misdirected  
- manipulated  
- reframed  

So I became the interpreter.

I learned to read:

- tone  
- facial expressions  
- the way someone entered a room  
- the energy between my parents  
- the slightest shift in mood  
- the emotional climate around me  

Hypervigilance isn’t a personality trait.  
It’s the nervous system adapting to unpredictability.

It kept me safe then.  
It exhausts me now.

## **3. The Parentified Child**

Because my dad was drowning  
and my mum was controlling and emotionally unavailable,  
I stepped into roles no child should fill:

- the mediator  
- the caretaker  
- the stable one  
- the emotionally mature one  
- the one who soothed adults  
- the one who managed tension  

I didn’t get to be held.  
I held everything.

Parentified children grow up quickly —  
but carry a lifetime of tenderness that never felt met.

## **4. The Child Who Took Responsibility for Adult Emotions**

When your parents are not emotionally regulated,  
you learn to believe that:

- your behaviour causes their moods  
- your needs create conflict  
- your emotions make things worse  
- your wants are burdens  
- your boundaries are dangerous  

This shaped my adult attachment style:

- fear of being too much  
- difficulty receiving  
- guilt around needs  
- fear of abandonment  
- attraction to emotionally unavailable people  
- difficulty trusting stability  

I wasn’t broken.  
I was shaped.

## **5. The Child Who Learned That Love = Endurance**

My dad endured so much.  
My mum expected so much.  
Love looked like:

- holding everything in  
- suppressing emotions  
- staying no matter what  
- accepting chaos  
- absorbing guilt  
- losing yourself to keep the peace  

It wired me to associate love with suffering.

Undoing that has taken years.

But I’m finally seeing it clearly.

## **6. The Moment I Realised I Was Not the Problem**

Growing up, I internalised the chaos as:

- my responsibility  
- my burden  
- my fault  

But the truth is something I can finally hold without collapsing:

**I was never the problem.  
I was the child responding to a problem.**

The roles I developed were adaptive, not pathological.

They kept me safe in a house where emotional logic didn’t exist.

And now, as an adult, I get to unlearn them.

Not because I’m doing something wrong —  
but because I no longer need them to survive.

---

## **What I’m Choosing Now**

I’m choosing:

- regulation over hypervigilance  
- needs over guilt  
- boundaries over self-abandonment  
- secure connection over chaos  
- honesty over emotional performance  
- softness over survival roles  

I’m no longer the child who had to survive that house.

I’m the adult who finally gets to live outside of it.
