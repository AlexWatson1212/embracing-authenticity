Today I had a small moment — maybe the most connected I’ve ever felt to myself.

It didn’t come from pushing, striving, or doing anything impressive. It arrived when I was lying in bed, feeling ill, tired, and a bit lonely. Normally, moments like this would send me towards coping mechanisms: porn, food, Hinge, reaching outward for someone to soothe the ache inside my chest.

But something different happened today.

Instead of abandoning myself the moment things felt heavy, I turned inward. I started speaking with the part of me that felt alone — the child inside who still wants presence, comfort, warmth, and someone to sit with him. And when I checked in with him, something softened.

I imagined holding him.  
I imagined him happy, doing somersaults, celebrating that I was finally listening.  
And he said something I didn’t expect:

**“I love you, Alex.”**

The emotion that hit me in that moment felt real in a way coping never does.

And I found myself saying back:

**“My pleasure.”**  
The most natural response. No pressure, no performance. Just warmth.

He trusted me.  
I trusted myself.

Not to be perfect.  
Not to show up every single day.  
But to always come back, even if I forget for a while.

He was suspicious but hopeful — which is exactly what a real child would feel. He didn’t need me to guarantee perfection. He just needed honesty. Something I can actually uphold.

And then, when I told him gently:

**“You can relax — I’m not going anywhere.”**

He said:

**“I know. Just… don’t make it too long.”**

The warmth I felt in my body after that was undeniable.  
Soft.  
Full.  
Light.  
Held.  
Warm.

Not a fantasy.  
Not escapism.  
A real, embodied moment of safety.

And the most freeing realisation?

**I don’t need to cling to this or try hard to recreate it.  
More moments like this will arise naturally.  
I can trust that.**

This wasn’t a transformation I must now maintain.  
It was a glimpse — a reference point.  
My system now knows what internal connection feels like.

Even though I’m still ill and heavy, and not ready to go outside, I’m enjoying being alone. Not lonely. Alone. With myself.

And for today, that is enough.
