Tonight I felt something I haven’t quite had words for until now:  
**I have arrived.**

It wasn’t a dramatic revelation.  
It wasn’t a collapse or a breakthrough.  
It wasn’t epiphany by force.

It was *recognition*.

A soft, certain knowing that the life I’ve been trying to build—the internal life, the grounded one, the regulated one, the one led by courage instead of fear—  
is no longer something I’m reaching for.

It’s something I’m living.

For the first time I can remember, I woke up excited for my day simply because it was *my* day.  
I love getting up in the morning.  
I love spending time with my son.  
I love the rhythm of our life.  
And I feel ready for whatever life brings, not because I’m chasing some breakthrough, but because I’m finally standing in myself.

The things I used to force—tidying, cooking, running, showing up for life—are simply happening now.  
My system wants them.  
My body wants movement.  
My mind wants clarity.  
My heart wants connection.

Vitality isn’t something I’m pursuing anymore.  
It’s something I’m carrying.

It’s subtle, grounded, steady.  
People around me sense it.  
I sense it.

I’m no longer waiting for a big leap to prove courage.  
I don’t need to escape to Scotland in a van to “show” that I’m alive.  
I don’t need a dramatic act to validate who I’ve become.

Because I have already become him.

The work now is integration—  
living, not searching.  
Feeling, not forcing.  
Continuing, not reinventing.

This post is the marker for that moment.  
The moment I realised I’m not healing in order to live anymore.

**I am healed enough to live.  
And now, I am living.**
