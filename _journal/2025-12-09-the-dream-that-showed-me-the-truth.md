This morning, just before waking, I had a dream that lingered long after I opened my eyes. In the dream, my mum was going to meet my ex’s “new partner” — a person who doesn’t even exist. Yet the emotional weight felt real, sharp, and unmistakably familiar.

It felt like betrayal.

Not the betrayal of a relationship, but the deeper betrayal of a parent aligning with someone else at my expense. A kind of emotional disloyalty I’ve carried for years without fully naming.

## The Symbol Beneath the Dream

My ex wasn’t the point. The “new partner” wasn’t the point. My mum choosing someone else — stepping over a boundary, exposing something vulnerable, abandoning me emotionally — *that* was the point.

The dream stitched together a pattern I’ve been slowly uncovering:

- My dad humiliated me publicly.  
- My mum humiliated me socially, sharing intimate details with anyone who would listen.  
- I grew up without protection, without privacy, without someone guarding my inner world.

The dream wasn’t random. It was a symbol of the emotional truth I’m finally ready to see.

## The Humiliation Wound

Watching a video about humiliation the night before must have cracked open an old door. Something resonated. Something clicked. It made sense of why shame takes up so much space in my system.

Humiliation wasn’t an occasional event — it was environmental.

It was the air in my childhood home.

I was laughed at, exposed, undermined, or used as emotional currency. That kind of upbringing doesn’t just disappear when you turn eighteen. It buries itself in the nervous system, shaping how you trust, how you connect, and how you expect people to treat you.

It explains why trusting others feels risky.
It explains why being seen feels dangerous.
It explains why shame sits so close to the surface.

## What the Dream Was Really Saying

Dreams simplify what life complicates.

This dream told me:

**“Your emotional betrayal wasn’t imagined.  
It happened.  
And you survived it.”**

The betrayal wasn’t about a partner.  
It was about a parent.

It was about growing up without being emotionally protected, without anyone defending my dignity or my inner world. And for a child, that kind of abandonment carves deep channels into the psyche.

## The Pattern in My Adult Life

Humiliation trauma shows up everywhere:

- Sensitivity to silence or withdrawal  
- Overthinking small interactions  
- Expecting rejection even where there is none  
- Pulling back when I feel too exposed  
- Feeling “wrong,” “too much,” or “not enough”  

These aren’t character flaws.  
They are adaptations — brilliant ones — from a childhood where being seen meant being hurt.

## The Shift Happening Now

What’s different today is that I’m no longer drowning in that shame. I’m observing it. Understanding it. Bringing it into daylight without collapsing under its weight.

This dream wasn’t a warning.  
It was a mirror.

A mirror showing me the truth I’ve been working toward:

**It was never my fault.  
It was the failure of the adults who were meant to protect me.**

And now, I get to protect myself.
I get to honour my privacy.
I get to reclaim my story.
I get to build trust slowly, safely, in relationships that feel mutual and real.

This dream opened a door — not to the past, but to the healing that finally makes sense of it.
