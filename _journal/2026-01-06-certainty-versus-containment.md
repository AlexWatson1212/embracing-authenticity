I’ve been thinking about the difference between *certainty* and *containment* — and how easily the two get confused, especially in therapeutic spaces.

They can look similar on the surface.  
But they do very different things underneath.

## What I’m Noticing

There’s a belief I encounter often — sometimes explicitly, sometimes quietly implied — that a therapist’s role is to bring *certainty*.

Certainty that:
- things will be okay  
- feelings make sense  
- there is a right way forward  
- someone knows  

Some clients find this soothing.  
Some professionals take pride in it.

But I find myself uneasy with it.

Because I don’t believe certainty is something we can honestly offer.

## The Problem With Certainty

Certainty, when you look closely, often carries a hidden promise:

> *Someone is still in control.*

It can resemble the reassuring presence of a parent who always knows what to do, who will step in when things go wrong, who ultimately keeps us safe.

The difficulty is — that isn’t how life works.

There are limits to:
- protection  
- prediction  
- rescue  

To offer certainty where none exists can unintentionally preserve the fantasy that someone else is holding the ground.

And when that fantasy eventually collapses — as it often does — the fall can be harder.

## What Containment Actually Is

Containment isn’t about answers.

It’s about *capacity*.

The capacity to sit with:
- not knowing  
- fear  
- grief  
- responsibility  
- the absence of guarantees  

Containment says:
> *I won’t rush you away from this.*

Not:
> *I can make this safe.*

But:
> *I can stay present while you feel what isn’t.*

That’s a very different offer.

## Why This Is Difficult

Existential truths don’t arrive gently.

Things like:
- *I can’t keep my child safe.*  
- *No one is coming to save me.*  
- *There is no final certainty.*  

These truths strip away comfort quickly.

Some people want help *avoiding* them.  
Some want help *meeting* them.

Containment is only helpful when someone is ready — or close to ready — to feel what’s underneath.

Timing matters.
Pacing matters.

But honesty matters too.

## Freedom on the Other Side

There is real pain in realising you are ultimately on your own.

But there is also:
- responsibility  
- adulthood  
- agency  
- freedom  

Not freedom from fear —  
but freedom from illusion.

For me, it feels kinder — though harder — to help someone discover their own footing, rather than leaning forever on borrowed certainty.

---

## The Open Question

When does reassurance become avoidance?  
And when does honesty become too much, too soon?

I don’t think the answer is fixed.

But I’m becoming clearer about the difference between *sounding confident* and *being able to stay*.

And which one I’m more interested in offering.
