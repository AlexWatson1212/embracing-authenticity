I woke again at around 3am, after five hours or so of sleep.

Nothing dramatic happened.  
No crisis.  
Just a dream, and a familiar feeling of being quietly *awake* while the rest of the world sleeps.

I’ve noticed something about myself over time:  
when I name the questions I’m genuinely sitting with, it often unsettles other people.

Not because I’m trying to provoke —  
but because I don’t soften the reality first.

## What I’m Noticing

In a recent session, I spoke about something simple on the surface:  
my son riding his bike into the road without checking.

What it brought up for me wasn’t panic — it was truth.

I can’t always keep him safe.

That’s not a thought many parents want to sit with for long.  
And suddenly I realised: I *could* sit with it — but the room couldn’t.

Even the tutor seemed to want to contain or close things down.  
At the time, I felt confused.  
On reflection, it makes sense.

I didn’t introduce fear — I exposed it.

## When Rationality Strips Meaning Away

Later, I found myself saying something that landed heavily:

Once everything is fully rationalised, there’s no inherent meaning left.  
No obvious reason to keep going.

Someone offered *absurdism* as a response — and I understand it —  
but to me, it still feels like an intellectual workaround.  
A way to reassign meaning once the old ones collapse.

The truth is more uncomfortable.

I don’t feel, in my bones, that there is a built-in point to living.

This isn’t suicidal.  
It’s not despair.

It’s clarity without cushioning.

## Refusing the Easy Answer

It would be easy to say *my son is my reason*.

But that feels dishonest.

It doesn’t feel fair to use another human being as a shield against my own existential fear.  
Even if I protect him.  
Even if I love him deeply.

If I remove everyone else — what’s left?

That question has followed me for most of my life.

## The Only Answer That Feels True (So Far)

What I’ve arrived at — quietly — is this:

The privilege to uncover myself.

Not to prove anything.  
Not to leave a legacy.  
Not to matter to the universe.

Just to know what it’s like to be *me* — without distortion, performance, or borrowed meaning.

It only really matters to me.

And that might be enough.

## The Dream

In the dream, I was heading to some kind of important gathering.  
There was someone there with gravitas — a record producer, a footballer, someone *significant*.

But I wasn’t dressed right.  
I felt out of place.  
And I never actually arrived.

What stayed with me wasn’t rejection —  
it was misalignment.

As if I couldn’t enter unless I betrayed myself.

## The Open Question

If life doesn’t come with meaning attached —  
and if I refuse to borrow it from others —  
what does it mean to live *honestly* anyway?

I don’t have an answer yet.

I’m just sitting with it.
