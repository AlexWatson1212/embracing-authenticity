## Choosing Instead of Being Chosen

Today I did something I’ve almost never done in my dating life:  
I told someone, gently and directly, **that I wasn’t feeling a spark**.

It wasn’t dramatic.  
It wasn’t emotional.  
It wasn’t a reaction to anything painful.

It was simply **clarity**.

For years, my pattern was the opposite. If someone liked me, I felt lucky. I felt chosen. I stepped into their world, tried to meet their needs, and convinced myself that this must be something special simply because *they* wanted me.

But today, and earlier this week too, I realised something that feels quietly revolutionary:

**I don’t have to be grateful just because someone shows interest.  
I’m allowed to choose too.**

The woman I spoke to today wasn’t unkind. She wasn’t wrong for me in an obvious way. The issue was simple: the connection was flat. She wasn’t curious about my world. She didn’t know herself deeply or wasn’t willing to show it. And the more we talked, the more I felt myself being pulled into an old dynamic — me bringing the colour, her bringing politeness. Me doing the emotional lifting, her offering very little in return.

It felt familiar.  
And that familiarity was the red flag.

In the past, this kind of dynamic would quietly pull me in. I’d stay out of guilt, loneliness, or a belief that this was as good as I could get. I’d become someone’s emotional pen pal until they found someone else, all while telling myself that this must be how healthy beginnings work.

But it isn’t.

Healthy beginnings have **reciprocity**.  
Curiosity.  
Playfulness.  
Warmth.  
Meeting each other halfway.

And today, when I sat with it, I realised:  
**There was none of that here.**

So I stepped away — kindly, calmly, and without apology.

This wasn’t about rejecting someone.  
It was about respecting myself.

And what’s interesting is that it didn’t feel harsh or avoidant.  
It felt mature.  
Grounded.  
Secure.

It felt like the adult in me finally taking the lead.

I used to end up with people who liked me far more than I liked them, simply because I wasn’t choosing — I was just being chosen. That’s how I slipped into relationships where boundaries got crossed, or where I became the emotional container for someone who wasn’t able to truly meet me.

But now?  
I’m noticing something new.

I’m getting **better matches**.  
More aligned people.  
More depth.  
More colour.

And the only reason that’s happening is because I’m finally filtering from a place of self-respect instead of fear.

Not every connection deserves to be explored.  
Not every conversation deserves my emotional presence.  
And not every woman I meet will be able to meet me.

This doesn’t make love rarer — it makes it **clearer**.

It means that when someone truly compatible shows up — someone who knows themselves, asks questions, gives warmth, and reveals their inner world — I’ll recognise it immediately.

Because I’m no longer settling for scraps.  
I’m no longer confusing politeness with connection.  
I’m no longer trying to revive something that never breathed.

Today, I chose me.  
And strangely, beautifully…

That choice didn’t feel lonely.  
It felt hopeful.
