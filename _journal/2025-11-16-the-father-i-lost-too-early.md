# The Father I Lost Too Early  
### Untangling Love, Helplessness & Generational Pain

I’m seeing my father more clearly now than I ever did when he was alive.  
Not because something changed about him, but because *I’ve* finally changed enough to see beneath the surface.

For years, I carried a version of him shaped by confusion, fear, and the things I witnessed as a child.  
But the deeper I look, the more I realise this:

**My dad wasn’t the source of the chaos I grew up in — he was the outlet.**

What I saw was the end of the chain, not the beginning.

## **He lived inside a system that slowly dismantled him**

He entered a relationship where:

- he had no real autonomy  
- every mistake was stored as evidence  
- every success was minimised  
- discipline was forced onto him  
- his voice was dismissed  
- his identity slowly dissolved  
- support was non-existent  
- isolation became the norm  

He lost friends.  
He lost work.  
He lost his confidence.  
He lost the freedom to be himself.

This wasn't because he was weak.

**It’s because he was systematically eroded.**

Years of emotional pressure can look like incompetence from the outside.  
But from the inside, it’s closer to a form of imprisonment.

## **His anger wasn’t the anger of a violent man — it was the grief of a trapped one**

When you’re emotionally cornered long enough, two things happen:

1. **You shut down**, because nothing you do makes things better.  
2. **Your frustrations leak out**, because there’s nowhere else for them to go.

He didn’t have power, so he tried to use volume.  
He didn’t have agency, so he tried to use force.  
His anger wasn’t him — it was the pressure cooker he lived in.

And in a twisted way, that actually makes the whole thing even sadder.

## **He was cast as “the bad father” — and he begged not to be**

One thing I’ll never forget is him saying:

> “Why do I always have to be the one to discipline them?”

That sentence is the quiet truth of our entire family system.

He was *given* the anger.  
She kept the innocence.  
He got the blame.  
She got the sympathy.  
He became the “problem.”  
She became the “victim.”

And children internalise that.

I did.

For years.

And only now, with distance and clarity, can I see how deeply unfair it was.

---

## **I admire him more now than I did then**

He wasn’t perfect.  
He made mistakes.  
He scared me at times.  
He disappointed me at times.

But when I look beneath it all, I see a man who:

- loved his children  
- held onto his values in impossible situations  
- tried to protect us the only way he knew  
- endured more than anyone should  
- stayed because he feared losing us  
- accepted the villain role rather than abandon his kids  
- lived with shame that wasn’t his  
- died earlier than he should have, probably from the weight of it all  

That’s not weakness.  
That’s heartbreak.

And I understand him now in a way I never could before.

## **The grief is layered**

I’m grieving:

- who he was  
- who he could have been  
- the life he never got to live  
- the father he tried to be  
- the father he wasn’t allowed to be  
- the childhood that never made sense  
- the silence he carried  
- the helplessness he lived in  
- the relationship we lost long before he died  

The grief isn’t clean or simple.

It’s tangled with compassion, sorrow, anger, and understanding.

But for the first time in my life, it feels like *mine*.  
Not inherited, not blurred, not distorted.  
Just… mine.

And that feels like a beginning, somehow.

---

## **What I’m choosing to carry forward**

I’m choosing to carry:

- his gentleness,  
- his curiosity,  
- his belief in me,  
- his quiet endurance,  
- and the love that existed beneath the noise.

And I’m choosing to leave behind the silence, the shame, and the exhaustion that never belonged to him — and definitely don’t belong to me.

This is the start of reclaiming him.

And reclaiming myself.
