# The Man I'm Becoming Now  
### Reclaiming Identity, Building Safety & Choosing a New Line of Becoming

For the first time in my life, I’m beginning to understand *who I am* — not through the roles I had to play, not through the expectations placed on me, not through the dynamics I survived, but through the person I’m becoming.

It turns out that healing isn’t just about looking back.  
It’s about what emerges in the space that appears once the past stops steering your life.

This is the space I’m in now.

The space where I get to decide.

## **1. I’m no longer the child who had to survive the house I grew up in**

For decades, the survival roles ran my life:

- the Good Child  
- the Emotional Translator  
- the Parentified Child  
- the one who held everything in  
- the one who avoided conflict  
- the one who carried guilt  
- the one who suppressed needs  
- the one who endured instead of lived  

But I’m not that child anymore.

Those roles kept me alive.  
Now they limit me.

And I can feel myself stepping out of them —  
not all at once, not perfectly, but steadily.

I’m learning to:

- speak instead of suppress  
- feel instead of cope  
- rest instead of endure  
- say no without guilt  
- want things without shame  
- express needs without terror  
- trust connection without collapsing  

This is adulthood — not in the performative sense, but in the emotional sense.

This is the part of me my parents never reached.

## **2. I’m building the internal safety I never had**

I never had emotional safety as a child.

There was tension, unpredictability, guilt, suppression, role-reversal, confusion.  
There was no place to land.

Now I’m learning to build that safety inside myself:

- slowing down  
- listening to my body  
- talking to my inner child  
- choosing grounded responses  
- recognising old patterns before acting  
- sitting with discomfort instead of reacting  
- choosing integrity over fear  

This internal safety is what allows me to break patterns instead of repeating them.

This is the foundation my son gets to grow up with — stability instead of survival.

I’m giving him what I never had.  
And in doing so, I’m giving it to myself.

## **3. I’m choosing values that weren’t modelled for me**

My parents lived within emotional scarcity.  
They didn’t have the tools, the awareness, the grounding, or the insight.

But I do.

So I’m choosing values that break directly away from the system I came from:

- honesty without cruelty  
- kindness without control  
- boundaries without guilt  
- vulnerability without fear  
- autonomy without punishment  
- connection without dependency  
- love without endurance  
- responsibility without shame  

These are the values of the man I’m becoming.

They’re not inherited.  
They’re chosen.

## **4. I’m becoming the father I needed**

My son will never have to decode my emotions.  
He will never be made responsible for my happiness.  
He will never fear my unpredictability.  
He will never be punished for needing me.  
He will never be the emotional adult in the house.  

I am giving him:

- clarity  
- warmth  
- presence  
- stability  
- honesty  
- consistency  
- boundaries  
- self-trust  

I’m not perfect — but I’m aware.

And awareness is what breaks generational patterns.

I’m raising him with freedom, not fear.

And because of that, he will grow into a man who chooses relationships, not survives them.

## **5. I’m claiming the right to live a life that’s mine**

For so long, my identity was shaped by:

- managing other people’s emotions  
- surviving a family system  
- absorbing guilt  
- keeping the peace  
- walking on eggshells  
- burying my anger  
- performing adequacy  
- protecting other people from the truth  

That’s over now.

I’m choosing:

- creative expression  
- emotional honesty  
- self-respect  
- a grounded, quiet strength  
- friendships built on depth  
- a home that reflects who I am  
- work that aligns with my values  
- a life where I don’t apologise for being myself  

This is what happens when you finally step out of the roles you were forced into:

You meet the person you were always meant to be.

## **6. I’m becoming someone my father never got the chance to become**

This part hits deeply.

My dad never got the freedom I’m now stepping into:

- emotional freedom  
- financial freedom  
- psychological freedom  
- relational freedom  
- bodily freedom  

He died before he could heal, before he could grow, before he could become who he really was.

So I’m carrying forward the best of him:

- his curiosity  
- his gentle humour  
- his softness  
- his values  
- his love  

And I’m carrying them into a life he never got to live.

In this way, part of him continues through me.

---

## **7. This is not the end — it’s the becoming**

Healing isn’t a destination.  
It’s a direction.  
A long, slow unfolding.

And I’m no longer walking backward.  
I’m no longer trapped in old roles.  
I’m no longer reliving the past on repeat.

I’m stepping into a future that looks nothing like where I came from.

And for the first time,  
that future feels like mine.

About Part Six

Yes — there can absolutely be a Part Six, and it would serve as the perfect closing chapter.

Part Six would be:

the integration

the synthesis

the “why this matters”

the identity beyond the story

the message to others

the message to your younger self

the legacy

the closure

the forward path
