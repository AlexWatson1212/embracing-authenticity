Lately I keep bumping into this simple but uncomfortable truth:

If I avoid every risk today,  
I don’t avoid pain —  
I just delay it into regret.

This isn’t a fully formed philosophy…  
just a feeling that refuses to leave.

## What I’m Noticing
Whenever I choose safety over possibility,  
it feels like I’m choosing to stay smaller than I want to be.

I hesitate to send the message.  
I hold back from going for the big shove in poker.  
I wait until confidence arrives —  
as if confidence comes **before** the leap.

There’s a tension between who I am  
and who I keep saying I want to become.

No answers yet — just honesty.

## Why I Think It Matters
The moments where I risk disappointment —  
a conversation, a boundary, a creative step —  
they move me forward, even when they sting.

And the moments where I freeze?  
They pile up into **what if**.

That’s the cost I’m becoming unwilling to pay.

## The Open Question
What would my life look like  
if I kept choosing the small leap now  
instead of the big regret later?
