*Says* doesn’t use words — and yet, it says everything.

It begins quietly, insistently.  
A looping pulse. A breath held.  
And then it builds — slowly, patiently —  
like a thought you’ve tried to suppress  
but keeps rising through the cracks of your calm.

It’s not dramatic.  
It’s not trying to impress.  
It’s just… honest.  
In the way that grief sometimes is.  
Relentless. Subtle. And eventually, impossible to ignore.

For me, this track is what it feels like when emotion has no language.  
When words would only flatten the truth.  
When all you can do is sit there, still, and let the waves rise and fall around you.

The build doesn’t offer resolution —  
not in the way you’d expect.  
There’s no grand crescendo, no neat emotional payoff.  
Instead, there’s a sense of surrender.  
A letting-go into the rhythm of what is.

In that, there’s peace.  
Not the peace of having figured everything out,  
but the peace of no longer needing to.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What are you feeling that you can’t put into words right now? What might happen if you stopped trying to translate it — and just allowed it to move through you, like music?*
