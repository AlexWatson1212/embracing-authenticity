*Grow As We Grow* by Ben Platt hits that tender place in me —  
the one that always thought I had to be "ready" to be loved.  
The one that believed healing had to come before connection.

But this song offers a softer truth:  
that maybe love doesn't require perfection — only presence.  
Not certainty — just willingness.

It’s not about *having grown.*  
It’s about *being willing to grow.*  
Together.

That’s powerful.  
Because I’ve often felt like I’m still *in process* — like a work in progress  
that no one should love until I’ve figured it all out.  
But the ache in this song reminds me: connection isn’t the reward for healing.  
It’s part of the path.

Ben’s voice carries this kind of vulnerable strength —  
the kind that says, *“I’m scared, but I’m still here.”*  
That’s the kind of love I want to give — and the kind I’m learning to receive.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What would it feel like to stop waiting until you’re fully healed — and start letting someone meet you where you are, as you grow?*
