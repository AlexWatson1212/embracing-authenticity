There’s something about this song that doesn’t just hit the heart — it wraps around it.  
Like the last voice you hear when you’re falling apart.  
Like the softest goodbye that still somehow cuts the deepest.

*Don't Forget About Me* by CLOVES feels like a whisper from the part of me that’s scared of being erased.

Not forgotten in the literal sense —  
but emotionally.  
Energetically.  
Like someone who once saw you deeply now acts like they never knew you.  
And you’re left holding all the memories, all the weight, all the words that were never spoken.

The vocal delivery is stripped and bare, as if she's singing straight from the wound — no polish, no protection.  
It mirrors the feeling of asking for something you know you might not get, but needing to ask anyway.  
Because if you don't, the silence might crush you.

There’s longing here. But also grief.  
The grief of what could have been.  
The grief of someone slipping away, slowly.  
And the grief of not knowing whether they even think of you at all anymore.

And yet —  
there’s a strange kind of love in this request.  
“Don't forget about me” isn’t about ego.  
It’s about being real to someone.  
Being held in their story, even if only in a quiet corner.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*When you ask not to be forgotten, what part of you is actually speaking — and what does it still hope for?*
