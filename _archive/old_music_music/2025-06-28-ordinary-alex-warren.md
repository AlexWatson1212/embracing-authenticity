*Ordinary* by Alex Warren hits like a quiet confession whispered into the night.  
It’s not just about love — it’s about self-worth.  
It’s about wondering if your everyday heart could ever be enough  
for someone who seems to shine brighter than you.

There’s a teenage ache to this song,  
but it’s not immature — it’s *pure.*  
It’s the kind of fear we don’t always outgrow:  
the fear that someone might love you… and then leave once they see the real you.

That’s what makes this track hurt in a tender way.  
It captures that raw space where love and self-doubt overlap —  
where being “ordinary” doesn’t mean boring,  
but rather vulnerable, unarmoured, deeply human.

And sometimes, that’s what hurts the most —  
being real, and still not being chosen.

But here’s the truth the song hints at but never quite says:  
You were never ordinary.  
Not to the right person.  
Not to your inner child.  
Not to yourself, if you truly look.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What parts of yourself do you label as “ordinary” — and could those be the exact parts that deserve to be loved most?*
