*Bulletproof* by FARR pulses like a heartbeat behind armour.  
Every beat, every lyric feels like someone trying to hold themselves together  
while screaming internally: *I’m not okay.*

There’s this aching paradox in the title — “Bulletproof.”  
Because the song isn’t about strength.  
It’s about pretending to be strong long enough to survive.

That lands hard for me.  
Because I know what it’s like to build up walls, to act unshakable,  
to wear the performance of “I’ve got this” when I really didn’t.

Sometimes you become so good at being “bulletproof”  
that even you start to believe it.  
But underneath? There’s just bruises. There’s just fear.  
And a deep hope that someone might see through it — and stay anyway.

The production of this track mirrors that feeling.  
It’s gritty and smooth at the same time — like resilience that’s wearing thin.  
You can feel the emotional whiplash of loving someone, pushing them away,  
and aching for them to break through your defences.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*Where in your life are you still trying to be bulletproof — and what might happen if you let someone see the wound instead?*
