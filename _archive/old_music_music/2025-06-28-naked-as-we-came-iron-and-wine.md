*Naked as We Came* is a lullaby for the soul —  
not to soothe it into forgetting, but to help it remember gently.  
It touches mortality with such tenderness,  
you almost forget how heartbreaking it really is.

The melody is so delicate it feels like it could break.  
But it doesn’t.  
It just holds you — in that place between loving someone deeply  
and knowing, eventually, you’ll have to let them go.

The line *“One of us will die inside these arms”*  
isn’t sung with fear — it’s sung with devotion.  
A quiet promise to stay.  
To care.  
To witness.

There’s an intimacy in this song that makes you want to reach out  
and hold someone — or maybe be held,  
without needing to say anything at all.

It reminds me that love isn’t about forever.  
It’s about presence.  
It’s about showing up, again and again,  
until one day, we don’t.

And even then —  
the love remains.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What does it mean to love someone, knowing you will one day lose them — and how might that awareness change the way you show up now?*
