<p class="principle-progress">Principle 7 of 7</p>

<p><em>A grounded orientation to desire.</em></p>

<p>
Desire is not the problem.
</p>

<p>
What causes pain is how desire becomes distorted when safety, love, or approval feel uncertain.
</p>

<p>
For many people, desire gets reshaped into:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>responsibility</li>
  <li>caretaking</li>
  <li>self-silencing</li>
  <li>over-adaptation</li>
  <li>waiting to be chosen</li>
</ul>

<p>
This principle is about learning to want without disappearing.
</p>

<h3>1. Wanting Is Not the Same as Needing</h3>

<p>
For a long time, wanting felt unsafe.
</p>

<p>
Wanting led to disappointment, shame, or the quiet message that my needs were too much, too inconvenient, or would not be met.
</p>

<p>
So I learned to adapt.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>to soften desire</li>
  <li>to intellectualise it</li>
  <li>to turn it into usefulness instead</li>
</ul>

<p>
This wasn’t weakness.
</p>

<p>
It was a strategy shaped in conditions where wanting carried risk.
</p>

<p>
Desire itself was never the danger.
</p>

<h3>2. Desire Becomes Cleaner When It Is Named</h3>

<p>
Unspoken desire often turns into:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>resentment</li>
  <li>confusion</li>
  <li>over-giving</li>
  <li>staying too long</li>
  <li>hoping without clarity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Naming what you want does not obligate anyone to give it to you.
</p>

<p>
It simply brings you back into honesty with yourself.
</p>

<p>
Clarity reduces self-betrayal.
</p>

<h3>3. Love Is Not Earned Through Disappearing</h3>

<p>
For me, love was once entangled with holding things together.
</p>

<p>
Stability, care, and emotional labour became the price of connection.
</p>

<p>
This principle draws a line:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>love is not rescue</li>
  <li>love is not management</li>
  <li>love is not self-erasure</li>
</ul>

<p>
Adult love is presence, honesty, and mutual care.
</p>

<p>
If desire requires shrinking, it is no longer love.
</p>

<h3>4. Authority Can Distort Desire</h3>

<p>
When someone holds power — to evaluate, approve, or withhold — desire can quietly shift.
</p>

<p>
Wanting becomes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>being seen correctly</li>
  <li>being approved of</li>
  <li>being chosen</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not pathology.
</p>

<p>
It is information.
</p>

<p>
Old wounds surface where power once determined safety.
</p>

<p>
The work is not to suppress this response, but to notice it — and stay with yourself instead of abandoning yourself.
</p>

<h3>5. It Is Not Anyone Else’s Job to Trigger You</h3>

<p>
Growth does not require being destabilised by others.
</p>

<p>
Deliberate triggering belongs in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>therapy</li>
  <li>consensual healing spaces</li>
  <li>relationships with explicit care and repair</li>
</ul>

<p>
It does not belong in authority-based dynamics.
</p>

<p>
This principle restores responsibility inward:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>notice when the past is speaking — and respond from the present.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
