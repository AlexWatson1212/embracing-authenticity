*A reflection on changing the relationship you have with your inner voice.*

Most people live with an internal voice that speaks far more harshly than anyone else ever would.

A voice that:
- judges  
- compares  
- rushes  
- shames  
- pushes  
- undermines  

Alongside it, quieter and often ignored, is another voice —  
one capable of steadiness, understanding, and care.

Learning to manage the inner critic isn’t about eliminating it.  
It’s about changing who holds authority inside you.

This is a skill that can be learned.  
And it changes everything.

---

## **1. The Inner Critic Isn’t You — It’s a Part of You**

The inner critic usually formed early.

Often, it developed to:
- prevent rejection  
- avoid punishment  
- reduce conflict  
- help you adapt  
- keep you safe  

It learned that pressure, vigilance, and self-attack might protect you.

Seen this way, the critic isn’t an enemy.  
It’s a misinformed protector that never updated its strategy.

Understanding this doesn’t excuse the harm —  
but it opens the door to compassion instead of war.

---

## **2. Learn to Notice the Critic Without Following It**

The critic tends to speak in absolutes:
- “You always get this wrong.”  
- “You’re falling behind.”  
- “You should be better by now.”  

When this voice appears, the first step isn’t to argue —  
it’s to notice.

You might quietly name it:
> *“The critic is here.”*

That small act creates space.

The moment you recognise a voice as *a part* rather than *the truth*,  
its grip loosens.

---

## **3. Respond With Steadiness, Not Force**

Fighting the inner critic often strengthens it.

A calmer response might sound like:
- “I hear you.”  
- “I know you’re trying to protect me.”  
- “This isn’t helpful right now.”  
- “I can handle this without being attacked.”  

You don’t need to silence the critic.  
You need to **lead it**.

This is the beginning of an inner adult taking their place.

---

## **4. Replace Judgment With Curiosity**

Harsh self-talk often hides something softer underneath.

Instead of:
- “What’s wrong with me?”

Try:
- “What just got stirred up?”  
- “What am I reacting to?”  
- “What feels threatened right now?”  
- “What do I need?”  

Curiosity dissolves shame.

The moment you become interested instead of condemning,  
the nervous system begins to settle.

---

## **5. Speak to Yourself the Way You Would to Someone You Love**

If someone you cared about was struggling,  
you wouldn’t motivate them through cruelty.

You would offer:
- understanding  
- perspective  
- patience  
- reassurance  

Self-compassion asks a simple question:
> *Why would I deserve less than that?*

This isn’t indulgence.  
It’s regulation.

People grow best when they feel safe — even with themselves.

---

## **6. Learn the Early Signals That the Critic Is Taking Over**

The critic often disguises itself as:
- perfectionism  
- overthinking  
- procrastination  
- comparison  
- urgency  
- harsh “motivation”  

When these patterns appear, it’s usually a sign that something inside you feels unsafe.

Rather than pushing harder, pause.
Soften.
Slow down.

---

## **7. Let Mistakes Be Experiences, Not Identities**

Everyone makes mistakes.

What causes lasting damage isn’t failure —  
it’s turning failure into self-definition.

A helpful reframe:
- *This was a moment, not a verdict.*  
- *I can learn from this.*  
- *I’m allowed to be imperfect.*  

Self-compassion doesn’t remove accountability.  
It makes repair possible.

---

## **8. Strengthen a Supportive Inner Voice Through Use**

Your compassionate voice grows the same way the critic did:  
through repetition.

You might practise phrases like:
- “I’m here.”  
- “We’ll take this step by step.”  
- “You don’t have to rush.”  
- “It makes sense that this is hard.”  
- “You’re allowed to rest.”  

At first, this voice may feel unfamiliar.  
Over time, it becomes the default.

---

## **9. Compassion Builds Strength — It Doesn’t Weaken It**

Many people fear that kindness toward themselves will lead to complacency.

In reality, self-compassion:
- increases resilience  
- supports responsibility  
- improves emotional regulation  
- strengthens relationships  
- reduces burnout  

Harshness creates compliance for a while.  
Compassion creates sustainability.

---

## **10. The Guiding Orientation:  
Become the Voice You Needed**

The inner critic often echoes old environments.

The work now is to develop a new inner presence —  
one that says:
- “You matter.”  
- “You don’t have to earn safety.”  
- “You can rest.”  
- “I won’t abandon you.”  

This is not weakness.

It’s maturity.

## Final Reflection

You won’t eliminate your inner critic.

But you can change who leads when it speaks.

When compassion holds authority,  
mistakes become information,  
shame loses its edge,  
and growth feels safer.

Be on your own side.

That relationship shapes every other one you will ever have.
