<p class="principle-progress">Principle 7 of 7</p>

<p><em>A grounded orientation to desire.</em></p>

<p>
Desire is not the problem.
</p>

<p>
What causes pain is how desire becomes distorted when love, safety, or approval feel uncertain.
</p>

<p>
When wanting feels risky, desire often gets reshaped into:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>caretaking</li>
  <li>over-responsibility</li>
  <li>self-silencing</li>
  <li>waiting to be chosen</li>
  <li>earning closeness through effort</li>
</ul>

<p>
This principle is about learning to want without disappearing.
</p>

<h3>1. Wanting Is Not Immaturity</h3>

<p>
For a long time, wanting felt unsafe.
</p>

<p>
Wanting carried the risk of disappointment, shame, or learning that my needs were too much, too inconvenient, or unwelcome.
</p>

<p>
So I adapted.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I softened desire</li>
  <li>I rationalised it</li>
  <li>I turned it into usefulness instead</li>
</ul>

<p>
This was not weakness.
</p>

<p>
It was a strategy shaped in conditions where wanting had consequences.
</p>

<p>
Desire itself was never the danger.
</p>

<h3>2. Desire Becomes Distorted When It Is Unnamed</h3>

<p>
Unacknowledged desire rarely disappears.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it tends to leak out as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>over-giving</li>
  <li>staying too long</li>
  <li>hoping without clarity</li>
  <li>resentment</li>
  <li>confusion about your own needs</li>
</ul>

<p>
Naming what you want does not obligate anyone to meet it.
</p>

<p>
It simply restores honesty with yourself.
</p>

<p>
Clarity reduces self-betrayal.
</p>

<h3>3. Love Is Not Secured Through Rescue</h3>

<p>
For me, desire once became entangled with responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Love was something maintained through:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>holding things together</li>
  <li>anticipating needs</li>
  <li>staying steady for others</li>
</ul>

<p>
This principle draws a line.
</p>

<p>
Desire does not require:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>rescuing</li>
  <li>managing</li>
  <li>carrying emotional weight for another adult</li>
</ul>

<p>
If wanting requires self-erasure, it is no longer love.
</p>

<h3>4. Desire Can Collapse Under Authority</h3>

<p>
When someone holds power — to evaluate, approve, or withhold — desire can quietly shift.
</p>

<p>
Wanting becomes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>being seen correctly</li>
  <li>being chosen</li>
  <li>being approved of</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not pathology.
</p>

<p>
It is a nervous system response shaped by earlier dynamics where power and safety were linked.
</p>

<p>
This principle is not about eliminating that response.
</p>

<p>
It is about noticing it — and staying with yourself rather than adapting to secure closeness.
</p>

<h3>5. Wanting Does Not Make You Unsafe</h3>

<p>
At the centre of this principle is a quiet fear:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>if I want clearly, I will lose connection</li>
  <li>if I stop adapting, I will be left</li>
  <li>if I choose myself, love will disappear</li>
</ul>

<p>
This principle challenges that belief.
</p>

<p>
Wanting does not make you selfish.
</p>

<p>
It makes you honest.
</p>

<h3>The Orientation: Want Clearly. Stay Present. Do Not Disappear to Be Loved.</h3>

<p>
Ask yourself:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Am I naming what I want — or hiding it?</li>
  <li>Am I adapting to be chosen — or choosing consciously?</li>
  <li>Does this desire expand me — or shrink me?</li>
  <li>Am I staying present with myself — or negotiating my worth?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Desire is not a demand.
</p>

<p>
It is information.
</p>

<p><strong>That is desire without self-betrayal.</strong></p>
