      <h2>To My Son, Victor</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Published May 2025</p>

      <p>If you’re reading this, then I’m no longer by your side in the way I wish I could be. But I need you to know something, with every fibre of who I am:</p>

      <p><strong>I loved you. I love you still. I always will.</strong></p>

      <p>You were the light in my life. The one person who reminded me what truly mattered — connection, laughter, being real, being present.</p>

      <p>I spent a lot of my life trying to make sense of things — of the world, of people, of pain. I didn’t always have the easiest time growing up. Sometimes, the people who should’ve loved me didn’t know how. And that left scars. But when you came into my life, you softened something in me. You reminded me what love could feel like — unconditional, gentle, and real.</p>

      <p>This website, and the things I left behind, are pieces of me. My thoughts, my truths, my struggles, and my growth. They’re not perfect — and I never expected myself to be — but they’re honest. And I hope they help you know me better, even if I can’t tell you these things in person.</p>

      <p>I want you to live fully, love deeply, and speak your truth. Don’t be afraid of your feelings. Don’t hide from the world, even when it’s hard. There’s strength in vulnerability. There’s wisdom in softness.</p>

      <p>Be kind to yourself. Especially in the moments when it feels hardest to be. You are enough, exactly as you are.</p>

      <p>I wish I could see the man you’ve become. But even without seeing it, <strong>I’m proud of you. So proud. Beyond words.</strong></p>

      <p>Love always,<br><strong>Dad</strong></p>
