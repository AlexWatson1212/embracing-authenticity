There’s a strange stillness to *Tomorrow Comes Today* —  
like you’re watching your life play out through a foggy window.  
The beat loops like a lazy thought, and the lyrics almost don’t want to be heard.  
It’s numbed-out. Drifting. Detached.

And somehow, that **is** the feeling.

This song reminds me of moments in my life where I felt like I was there,  
but not really there.  
When everything around me was moving, but I was just kind of… floating.  
Disconnected. Silent. Existing, but not engaged.

There’s something beautifully sad about that.  
Like watching yourself disappear slowly, not in a dramatic way —  
but in the kind of way that no one else even notices.

The phrase *“tomorrow comes today”* hits hard.  
Because when you’re stuck in that emotional freeze, every day feels the same.  
There’s no future to move toward — just more of the same grey.

This song doesn’t try to fix it.  
It just sits in it.  
And sometimes, that’s exactly what you need —  
a soundtrack for your stillness.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*When was the last time you felt like you were watching your life from the outside — and what part of you was asking to be noticed again?*
