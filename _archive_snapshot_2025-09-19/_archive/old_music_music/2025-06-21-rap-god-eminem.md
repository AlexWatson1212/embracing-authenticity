You don’t just listen to Rap God —  
you ride it.

The pace. The precision. The fire.  
It’s a song that makes your nervous system sit up and say, “Let’s go.”

There are layers of arrogance, of course. But also mastery —  
and when you’ve felt small or invisible, that kind of mastery feels magnetic.

I’ve noticed something interesting.  
A lot of the young people I’ve worked with really connect with this track.  
And it’s not just about Eminem being fast.  
It’s about what that speed represents:

Power.  
Skill.  
Control — in a world where they often feel like they have none.

There’s this kind of quiet pride that lights up when a kid can rap the whole thing, word for word.  
It’s not just fun — it’s identity.  
It’s belonging to something fast, sharp, and untouchable.

My son loves this song too.  
And honestly, that’s one of the reasons it hit me differently.

Because there have been moments in my life where I’ve felt completely hopeless.  
Moments where nothing made sense.  
But *Rap God* gave me this strange kind of charge.  
Like, even if everything’s a mess, I can still go off for six minutes straight and feel alive.  
It doesn’t solve anything — but it reminds you that you exist. That you matter.  
That somewhere inside you, there’s fire.

It’s not emotional in the traditional sense —  
but it moves something.

And sometimes, movement is what saves you.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What gives you that sense of power when you’re at your lowest — and could it be a doorway into a part of you that still believes in your strength?*
