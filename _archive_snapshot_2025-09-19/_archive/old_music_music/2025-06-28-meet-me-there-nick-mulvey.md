*Meet Me There* by Nick Mulvey doesn’t ask much of you.  
It doesn’t demand healing or change.  
It simply *invites*.

The gentle picking of the guitar, the warmth of his voice —  
they feel like a safe space being offered.  
A whisper: “You don’t have to do this alone.”

This song lands softly in the body,  
like the feeling of watching the wind in the trees, or sunlight on a quiet wall.  
It speaks not to the mind, but to the soul.  
And the message is simple: *come back to yourself.*

For me, it feels like a place my inner child would hide —  
not in fear, but in hope.  
Waiting for me to arrive, not with answers,  
but with presence.  
With softness.  
With willingness to sit in silence and just *be*.

“Meet me there” becomes a kind of mantra —  
an invitation inward.  
A reminder that no matter how far we’ve drifted,  
there’s still a space inside that’s waiting,  
with open arms.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*What part of you is waiting to be met with compassion, not correction? Where in your life might a softer presence make more difference than more effort?*
