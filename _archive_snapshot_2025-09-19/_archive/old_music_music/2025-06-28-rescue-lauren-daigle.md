*“You are not hidden.”*

There’s something about *Rescue* that breaks me open  
in the best possible way.  
Because it doesn’t sound like a song sung *to* someone —  
it sounds like a song sung *through* someone.  
Like a soul-to-soul transmission.

And when I hear it,  
I don’t imagine a romantic partner.  
I don’t imagine a friend.

I imagine *me*.  
Speaking to the little boy I was.  
The one who waited too long for someone to come.  
The one who kept quiet because he thought no one would care.  
The one who learned to be small because it was safer.

> *“I will rescue you.”*

I wish I could have said that back then.  
I wish I could have showed up,  
wrapped my arms around him,  
looked into his eyes and said,  
*“You’re not crazy. You’re not too much. You’re not invisible.”*

But I couldn’t.  
I didn’t have the voice.  
I didn’t have the tools.

Now… I do.

So I let this song be the bridge.  
A sacred re-pairing — the kind that doesn’t change the past,  
but changes how the past lives inside me.

Because *Rescue* isn’t just a message.  
It’s a vow.  
To never leave him behind again.  
To keep showing up.  
Even in the quiet.  
Even in the dark.  
Especially when he thinks no one hears his cry.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*If you could speak to your inner child right now, what would you say? And what do you think they still need to hear?*
