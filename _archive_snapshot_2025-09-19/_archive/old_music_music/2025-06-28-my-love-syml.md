There’s something sacred about *My Love* by SYML.  
Like a conversation that’s happening at soul level.  
Like someone singing from the other side of loss — not trying to escape it, but sitting quietly beside it.

The lyrics are sparse, but each line carries weight.  
*My love, there’s only you in my life…*  
It doesn’t scream. It doesn’t beg.  
It just aches.

This track feels like it was written for a moment you can’t get back.  
Or for a person who never truly left,  
even if they’re no longer near.

It plays like a lullaby for grief —  
gentle, reverent, intimate.  
The kind of love that doesn’t need to be loud to be real.  
The kind that lingers, even in silence.

For me, *My Love* is what it sounds like to still love someone,  
even when they’re gone.  
To still whisper to them in the quiet.  
To still hope they hear you.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
*Who do you still speak to in the quiet moments — even if only in your heart? What would you say to them now, if you could?*
