      "content": "The thought came in quietly this morning, but it landed hard:  “Why would anyone want to love me?”Not out of self-pity — just truth. Just reality.Because I’ve never been loved consistently.Not by my mother.Not by my sister.Not by past partners.Not in a way that felt secure, stable, and safe.And now that I’ve faced that, now that I’ve stopped spinning stories to soften it, I sit here wondering:Who would want to come into that?Who would walk into a life like mine — raw, unstable, so deeply human — and choose to stay?Because I’m not offering a rescue mission.There’s no polished version of me waiting just around the corner.There’s just me. Healing. Slowly. Openly.Still tired. Still unsure. Still real.And I get scared — not just of being unloved, but of being unlovable.Of being too late. Too broken. Too much.But then, somewhere in the quiet, a different voice whispers:  Maybe the kind of person I’m longing for isn’t someone who wants to fix me…Maybe they’re someone who wants to walk beside me, just as I am.Not because they feel sorry for me.Not because they want to sacrifice themselves.But because they see me — truly see me — and still choose to stay.Because maybe the things I’m most afraid to show are the things that will one day make someone feel safe with me.Not in spite of my humanity — but because of it.I don’t know when or how that kind of love might find me.But I know this:I’m not waiting to be rescued.I’m just learning to stop hiding.And maybe, just maybe, that’s what makes me lovable after all."

      "content": "If my mother read this, she’d probably say she loved me.She might feel hurt. Dismissed.She’d say, “Of course I loved you.”But I can’t think of a single consistent memory where I actually felt loved by her.Not in the way a child needs. Not with warmth. Not with safety. Not with presence.And it’s not just her.My sister too. The coldness, the emotional distance, the way I was treated — like a burden, like something to keep at arm’s length.And for years, I tried to rationalise it all.I thought:  Maybe I just don’t understand how they show love.Maybe I’m the problem.Maybe I’m too sensitive.Maybe they’re broken, but deep down they care.Because the alternative — the idea that it wasn’t love at all — felt impossible to bear.But what if it wasn’t love?What if it was duty, performance, control?What if their version of love came without empathy — without the capacity to see me, hold me, or meet me emotionally?What if I’ve been trying to turn absence into affection this whole time?And what if, finally, I don’t have to do that anymore?I don’t need to demonise them. I’m not here to rewrite history with rage.But I am here to stop lying to myself.Because defending them means betraying the child in me who knows the difference.That part of me — the boy who waited for love that never came — doesn’t need more excuses.He needs truth. He needs space. He needs to be believed.So maybe I’ll never get an apology.Maybe they’ll go on believing they loved me all along.But I know how it felt.And I’m finally allowed to trust that.What if that wasn’t love?And what if that’s exactly where real healing begins?"

      "content": "Lately, I’ve been noticing something — especially with my cousin and my uncle.Every time I make a light-hearted joke, it somehow turns into a problem.Recently, they were saying how good my cousin used to be at football, and that he even kept a photo of himself in his pocket. I said something like,  “You carry that around just in case someone needs proof you played?”It wasn’t meant to be cruel. It wasn’t even a serious dig.But the reaction I got? Offended. Cold. Like I’d just stepped out of line.And it made me think: maybe my jokes aren’t being received as jokes.But then again, maybe they’re not just jokes.Maybe they’re me trying to tell the truth in the only way I know how.Maybe they’re little expressions of resentment that I haven’t even fully processed.Because the reality is — my cousin has never once reached out to me. Not in my darkest moments. Not ever.There’s no real relationship there. No effort. No warmth.And yet somehow, when I make a passing joke, I’m the one who’s done something wrong.Same thing with my uncle. He kept interrogating me:  “What are you doing with your life?”“Where are you working?”“What’s going on?”Like he was waiting to catch me out.Like my life was something he had the right to inspect.And all I could say, over and over again, was:  “I’m doing really well, mate. Don’t worry about it.”I didn’t snap. I didn’t lash out. But the truth?He annoys the hell out of me. I hope I never see him again.Not because I’m full of rage — but because I’m done explaining myself to people who don’t actually care.And maybe that’s the realisation beneath all of this:  I’ve spent years trying to belong in a family that doesn’t really see me.Trying to connect with people who don’t want to hear me — not really.They’re not interested in who I am.They’re more invested in who they think I should be.And when I step outside of that — with honesty, humour, emotion — I’m labelled as too much, too sensitive, too rude.But I’m not any of those things.I’m just done pretending.Maybe my jokes are sometimes jabs.Maybe they’re ways of defending myself without starting a war.But maybe, more than anything, they’re my body’s way of saying:“This isn’t safe, and I know it.”I’m not trying to burn bridges.But I’m also not going to keep crossing them just to be ignored on the other side.If they can’t hear me, that’s no longer my responsibility to fix."

      "content": "There’s a specific kind of grief that doesn’t come all at once — it trickles in quietly, then suddenly knocks the wind out of you.I think I’m on the edge of collapse. The reality that I’ve never been loved consistently — not truly, not safely — has finally landed. Not just intellectually, but in my bones. And it’s gut-wrenching. It makes sense of the psychosis. Of the disconnection. Of the need to fabricate a story where maybe someone, somewhere, loved me for real.But there’s no story that makes it untrue. I haven’t been.And yesterday, that truth ran through my body so intensely, I ate three-quarters of a lemon cake just to feel something soft. To avoid something unbearable. Maybe even to avoid my son — because being near him stirs something in me that’s too raw. He is everything I wasn’t allowed to be. Joyful. Playful. Loved.That contrast cuts deep.I woke up at 4am today with my stress spiking all night. My body battery was at 29%. I’ve got nothing left — but I still want to show up for my son. Even as I question whether I’m self-sabotaging, whether the cake was an escape, whether part of me was just trying to get out of parenting.But it’s not that I don’t want to be there. It’s that I want to be well enough to be there. Present. Real. Not a shell.I haven’t asked his mum for help yet — it’s 4:30 in the morning as I write this, and I’m planning to wait until eight or nine before I ask. But I’m already holding space for whatever the answer is. I’ve barely asked in three years. I’ll show up tonight if I need to, but I’ll do it from survival mode — with softness. With honesty.A Survival PlanToday is not about thriving. It’s about preserving.  Eat something warm and grounding.  Lie down when I can, even for five minutes.  Let love be quiet tonight. Maybe a film. Maybe just parallel play.  Don’t perform. Just exist.It’s strange how sometimes I’d sit at my computer and my energy would lift — like I was climbing. But today, with the full weight of this truth in me, I feel like I’m sinking. The sadness is too thick. And I understand now why I’ve struggled for so long.Not being loved consistently doesn’t make me unlovable. It makes me tender. It makes me someone who had to build love from scratch — love for my son, love for myself, love for the world, even when I never saw the blueprint.No one else was responsible for giving me that love. But it wasn’t my fault that they didn’t.I’m still here.Still writing.Still trying.And that, somehow, is enough."

Not just the food, but what it represents.I ate three-quarters of it yesterday.I also had McDonald’s for lunch.And I don’t feel overwhelmed with shame — not like I used to. Just… present. Aware.I know exactly why it happened.I’ve been moving through something huge.Facing the truth that I’ve never been loved consistently. Sitting in emotional pain that’s been simmering under the surface for years. That kind of reality doesn’t just land in the mind — it lands in the body.So I reached for something soft. Something sweet. Something that wouldn’t leave.And yeah, part of me still wants to lose weight.Part of me wants to be healthy. Light. Grounded.But I can’t shame myself there.And the truth is, I’ve started noticing something else too:  When I’m not with my son, I tend to eat better.When I’m with him, I often reach for comfort food.It’s not his fault. Not even close.It’s my nervous system reacting to the emotional weight of parenting — of being in the presence of someone who reminds me of everything I never got. His joy. His need. His innocence. It stirs grief I’m only just learning how to hold.And instead of shaming that, I’m learning to accept it.To sit with it.To say: “This makes sense.”There’s still a little shame. But it’s less. And that means something.Because the lemon cake wasn’t the problem.It was a message. A moment. A coping strategy that made sense at the time.And the more I listen to my body without judgment,the more I believe that change will come — not through willpower, but through kindness.One gentle moment at a time."

      "content": "I don’t think I realised how emotionally intense college would be — not because of the course content, but because of what safety does to a system that’s lived in survival for too long.During my Level 2 and 3 counselling training, I spent most of my time overwhelmed and overstimulated. Anxious before every session. Taking breaks just to breathe. Struggling to show up. Not because I didn’t care — but because I cared so much, and my nervous system didn’t know how to process it.For the first time in a long time, I was in an environment where people genuinely cared. And instead of that bringing me ease, it brought everything I’d been missing into focus.It triggered a deep, buried grief.  This is what connection could feel like? This is what I’ve been without?On my very first day, I had an open conversation with someone who felt emotionally present — and instead of feeling happy, I felt wrecked.It exposed the absence. The silence. The emptiness I’d lived with.And every week, showing up to that space reactivated that grief.It’s taken me almost a year to regulate within it.To let my body know: this is safe now.To not crumble from the weight of being seen.At some point, I noticed myself becoming drawn to someone in the group — someone I liked. And I’ve wondered, was that just me trying to hold onto the emotional safety I felt around her?Maybe part of it was.But that doesn’t make it fake.Because the truth is, I did like her.She’s a genuinely wonderful person — emotionally intelligent, kind, warm. I wasn’t projecting onto a blank screen.She’s someone worth liking.And I don’t regret that I did.Even now, I’m learning not to overanalyse every feeling. Because if I did, I’d never move. Never connect. Never try.This whole experience — the emotional overwhelm, the silent grief, the slow regulation — has taught me more than any textbook ever could:  Sometimes safety doesn’t bring peace right away.Sometimes it opens the floodgates.Not because something’s wrong — but because we’re finally safe enough to feel what’s been buried all along.And I’m proud of the me who kept turning up.Who kept breathing.Who kept softening, even when it hurt.Because that’s not collapse.That’s healing.

      "content": "Lately I’ve been facing one of the hardest truths of my life:  I don’t think I’ve ever been loved consistently.Not by my parents. Not by my family. Not in the way I needed.And with that truth comes a deeper fear:  “If I’ve never been loved, how could anyone love me now?”“Why would someone walk into this mess and choose to stay?”It’s a hollow, heavy feeling.But in the midst of that, I started to wonder — has anyone else felt this?Has anyone else lived through this kind of ache, this absence, and still found a way through?So I looked. And what I found moved me.Vincent van GoghHe was never truly seen in his lifetime. Rejected by most, misunderstood by nearly all — even his own family. His love was rarely returned. But he kept painting, kept expressing, kept feeling. He poured his longing into colour and shape, and in doing so, he left behind a legacy that says:  “You don’t have to be loved to create something that loves others.”Frida KahloShe lived in chronic pain — physical and emotional. Betrayed by those closest to her. Yet she painted through it. Not to hide, but to be seen. Her self-portraits were a defiant kind of honesty.  “This is me,” they say. *“All of me.”She didn’t wait to be understood. She painted herself anyway.Carl JungJung came from a cold, emotionally distant home. He often felt alone, unable to speak about the things that truly mattered. So he created a framework for understanding the human psyche — shadow, inner child, self — all tools he used to reconnect with what he’d lost.  His loneliness became a map for others trying to find wholeness.Maya AngelouAbandoned. Silenced. Traumatised. Maya stopped speaking for years. But when she found her voice again, she used it to uplift others. Her truth was painful, but she didn’t let it close her.  She became a voice for everyone who had ever felt too broken to speak.Jean-Michel BasquiatRaised in chaos. Emotionally neglected. Criticised and commodified. But Basquiat took his pain and painted the rawness of the world. His art was frantic, emotional, true.  He made noise for those who were never allowed to speak.James BaldwinRejected by family. Marginalised by society. Baldwin carried deep wounds, and yet he wrote with empathy, clarity, and grace. He understood that our heartbreak connects us — and that telling the truth is how we begin to heal.  “You think your pain is unprecedented… but then you read.”So what does this mean for me now?It means I’m not alone in this.I’m not the only one who’s lived without consistent love.And I’m not the only one who’s wondered whether I’m lovable because of it.These people didn’t wait to be rescued.They didn’t numb it away.They created through it. They spoke. They painted. They stood still in the storm and let others see them soaked.  And maybe that’s what I’m learning now —that I don’t need to be fully healed to be real.I don’t need a perfect past to offer something honest.I don’t need to have been loved to start loving — myself, others, life.Because pain is not the end of the story.Sometimes, it’s where the real one begins.If you’ve never been loved consistently — I see you.And I promise: you’re not alone.Some of the brightest lights came from people who once thought no one would ever come near them.And they still became something beautiful.

It isn’t loud. It’s quiet. Devastating. Honest.And it starts here:I don’t want to lie to myself anymore.I don’t want to keep holding space for the “maybes.”Maybe my mother loved me.Maybe my sister does.Maybe my ex-partner did.Maybe my friends cared.Maybe I had friends at all.But deep down, I know: those were stories I told myself so I didn’t fall apart.Because the truth is: if they did love me, it was inconsistent, conditional, or distorted. It was love that left me questioning my worth, my place, my sanity.It wasn’t the kind of love that holds you when you’re breaking. It wasn’t the kind that sees you fully and stays. It wasn’t the kind I give to my son.And admitting that — admitting I’ve never been loved consistently — is like ripping the final bandage off a wound I’ve been carrying for decades. It’s grief on a cellular level.But it’s also freedom.Because if I stop waiting for love to come from people who can’t give it… maybe I can finally start building something real. Something grounded. Something honest. Not made from desperation or performance, but from presence.If I stop lying to myself — I mean really stop — maybe there’s space for truth to grow. Maybe something solid can finally rise where the illusion used to live.And maybe, just maybe, I can build a life not out of survival…but out of truth.No more crumbs.No more maybes.No more lies.Just this:I was never loved the way I needed.And now, I will learn how."

I stayed honest. I reached for help.Not from desperation, but from grounded self-awareness.I knew that asking my son’s mum would give me the best chance to truly recover. A whole evening off — space to rest not just physically, but emotionally. And that’s what I need most. That’s what allows me to be present for him when I’m back.If she can help, that’s ideal. And if not, I have another option — a friend I trust, someone who might say yes, even if I can’t return the favour right now. I’d still carry some responsibility in that setup, still be thinking about Vic, but it would be enough of a lift to get me through the day with a bit more grace.And if neither of them can help — then I’ll do what I’ve always done. I’ll show up. I’ll get through it. I’ll find a way.But what’s changed — what really matters — is that I didn’t go straight into lone-wolf mode. I didn’t shut down, or pretend I was fine, or grit my teeth through another silent collapse.I paused. I considered. I asked.And in that moment, I realised something else:  I may not have a village yet…but I do have some people that care.That means something.It means I’m not as alone as I used to feel.It means I’m becoming someone who can receive help — not just give it.And maybe, just maybe, this is how a village begins."

Not in the way a child should be. There may have been moments of care to keep up appearances, but I was never emotionally seen, never nurtured, never safe.With my father, there were glimmers. Maybe even something resembling love at times. But even those were brief and inconsistent — always surrounded by emotional distance, or overshadowed by pain.And in friendship? I’m not sure. I think I often gave more than I received, hoping that if I poured enough of myself into others, they’d choose to stay. But I don’t know if I was ever really known.Even my one romantic relationship — the one that I thought was real — feels hollow when I look back. She never asked about my family. Never showed interest in my story, my dreams, my inner world. It was all surface. It hurts to admit, but I don’t think she loved me. Maybe she loved the idea of me. Maybe I loved the idea of being loved.The truth is, I didn’t know what love looked like — so I couldn’t recognise its absence.I just accepted what was there. Because I was desperate. And it’s only now, with some distance, that I can see how little I was given.It’s fucking sad.It’s the kind of grief that doesn’t have a clear start or end — because you’re not mourning what was, you’re mourning what should have been. What was never there.But even in that sadness, there’s something else too:I’m not numb anymore.I’m not pretending it was fine.I’m not blaming myself.I’m finally feeling it.And that means something is shifting.I don’t know what comes next.

      "content": "If the only part of me that risks getting bruised by living this way is my ego — then that’s a cost I’m willing to pay.Because if showing up as I am — emotionally present, willing to be misunderstood, grounded in something bigger — helps even one person feel safe enough to be themselves, then the ripples are worth it.I think about the young people I support through volunteering at Barnardo’s.If this work helps me hold better presence for them — makes me more regulated, more open, more real — then it’s already worth something.If someone misjudges me or jokes about my masculinity, and all that gets wounded is my ego?So be it.Because my ego used to mean everything to me.Now, it doesn’t.Now, my purpose matters more.What I BelieveI believe every human deserves to be seen, loved, and accepted exactly as they are — and to have the right conditions to become who they’re meant to be.But with children, that belief holds a deeper gravity. Because children don’t have the luxury of reparenting themselves — not yet. They adapt. They survive. They contort themselves around what’s tolerated, what’s safe, what’s familiar.And sometimes, in that survival, they lose themselves completely.When a child has even one adult who sees them with calm, regulated presence — who accepts them without needing anything in return — something begins to form inside them. A quiet trust. A stable centre. Even if that adult is no longer there in the future, that feeling remains.They carry that sense of safety into the world.They move through life with more trust — in themselves, and in others.They grow up anchored.But when a child is raised by someone who never learned how to hold emotional space — someone whose shame spills into the room, who unconsciously asks their child to regulate them — it creates a different kind of ripple.It can shape a child into someone who distrusts love.Who rejects their own needs.Who learns to anticipate, fix, and silence themselves.And I know that ripple all too well — because I lived it.The Wound I CarryI know what it’s like to not be held emotionally.To not feel loved in the way that mattered.And it leaves a wound that doesn’t just sit quietly — it shows up everywhere.It makes it hard to trust people.Hard to let love in.Hard to even trust it when it’s finally there.The negative impact has been immense. And what’s difficult to sit with is this:What I needed wasn’t impossible to give.It wasn’t some heroic act of sacrifice.It was presence.Regulation.Care.But instead, I was shaped around someone else’s unmet needs. And I know I’m not alone in that. I think it’s more common than we’d like to admit.What I Refuse to Pass OnBecause of that, I make a vow every day — especially in how I parent my son.I refuse to let my insecurities leak into him.I refuse to make my emotional regulation his responsibility.He didn’t choose to be born — and he shouldn’t be expected to take care of me.Children should have the space to grow into themselves, not shrink to fit the needs of adults who never learned how to hold their own pain.When a child is born into a home where their role is already assigned — to soothe, to perform, to rescue — they’re robbed of the most basic human right: to simply be.I won’t let that happen to him.And I won’t let that happen to the young people I work with either — not if I can help it.The Ripple EffectI used to think staying quiet made me kind.That speaking the truth would make me unlikable.But now I see it differently.If something I say makes a parent pause — even feel uncomfortable or called out — maybe that moment of discomfort is a gift.Maybe it leads them to reflect.And maybe that reflection, painful as it might be, helps their child.Because truth doesn’t only serve the person hearing it — it ripples into the lives of those around them, especially the ones too small to voice their own pain.So I’ll speak.I’ll risk being misunderstood.I’ll let the ego bruise.Because the ripple matters more than the surface.Because children are worth the truth.And because I’d rather live with a soft, open heart than a silent one.This post is just a beginning. I’ll come back and shape it more later. But for now, this is what I needed to say.And I trust that someone, somewhere, might need to hear it.  "

      "content": "Sometimes, I think it couldn’t be worse — emotionally speaking.No friends. No partner. No real, sustained love across my life.I used to pretend that wasn’t true.Now I see it. And it’s crushing.Because I’ve started to let myself feel. I’ve opened up in therapy. I’ve started to show myself in group counselling. And oddly — painfully — that’s when the grief came.Not because those spaces are unsafe… but because they are.And for the first time, my body is beginning to realise just how much I never had.I’ve never truly been loved.Not by my mother.Not in friendship.Not in partnership.Just tiny glimmers, here and there — mostly from people trained to offer it. Therapists. Counsellors. People who hold space professionally.And now that I know what it feels like to be met, even a little…I see the void that came before. The gap where love should have been.And I’m exhausted. Not just tired — deeply drained. As if my whole nervous system is catching up to the truth it’s spent a lifetime avoiding.And yeah — I’m eating half a lemon drizzle cake.Not because I’m hungry, but because I need something to hold me.Something soft. Something sweet. Something that doesn’t abandon me.I don’t think people realise what it does to a person — to go unloved for decades, and then be judged for how that pain shows up.I was desperate for connection. And instead of care, I was often mocked. Dismissed. Seen as less. Like my loneliness made me defective.But it didn’t. It made me human.I acted out not because I was flawed — but because I was starved.Starved of love. Starved of reflection. Starved of safety.And now that I’m finally learning what those things feel like…Now that I feel a sense of love in my training group…I realise how much I’ve missed.And it breaks me.Not in a way that destroys me.But in a way that reveals me.In a way that says, “Yes, this is grief. But you’re finally feeling it now. That’s how it heals.”So I’ll sit here. Full of lemon cake. Full of sadness.Not because I’m failing.But because I’m finally beginning to grieve the life I never got —And maybe, slowly, open the door to one I can still create."

      "content": "It makes sense that I believe I’m unlovable.Not because I am, but because that belief was installed early — in the moments when I needed love the most and didn’t receive it. The absence of warmth, of emotional reflection, of being seen… it all left a gap. And into that gap, my mind inserted a story: “There must be something wrong with me.”That’s not just a belief. That’s a survival strategy. A way to make sense of the chaos.Because the alternative — that the people who were meant to love me didn’t or couldn’t — was too painful to bear.So my ego took that story and built a world around it.I’m unlovable became the script.And once that script was in place, everything else followed:  I mistrusted care.  I downplayed my needs.  I rejected people before they could reject me.  I settled for less because “at least it was something.”The ego doesn’t like being wrong. Especially when the belief it’s protecting has become your foundation.Even if that foundation is full of cracks.It’s not cruelty. It’s fear.The ego says: “This story kept you safe. Don’t let it go.”But here’s what I’m learning:Just because something kept me safe then, doesn’t mean it serves me now.I’m grieving the truth behind that belief. Not because it was right, but because I followed it for so long.I understand now: I wasn’t unlovable — I was unseen.There’s a difference.And I’m slowly learning to see myself, even if the ego still flinches.This isn’t about blame. It’s about clarity.About watching the story unravel — not to shame myself, but to set myself free.Because maybe I was never meant to carry the story of unlove.Maybe it was just the echo of someone else’s inability to love at all."

The magnitude of it.I think I imagined that if I went far enough, deep enough, I might finally find whatever it is I’ve been chasing — or maybe just be far enough from everything to hear myself clearly.But something’s shifted.It’s not that Norway isn’t beautiful — it’s that the push to get there suddenly feels out of sync with the pull inside me now.I realized that what I’m really looking for isn’t scale — it’s space.Not distance — but depth.And the truth is… two weeks wouldn’t be enough for Norway. Not in the way I’d want to experience it. I’d be rushing. Chasing. Pushing myself through ferry timetables and foreign roads just to say I did it. Just to feel something.But that’s not what I need.What I need is something slower. Something softer. Something that lets me exhale.So I’m going to Scotland.And the moment I made that decision, my whole body softened.It still has the wildness. The quiet. The kind of landscapes that stir something ancient in me.But it also comes with flexibility. With freedom. With trust.If something doesn’t feel right, I can come home. If I want to stay longer in one place, I can.There’s no need to prove anything. Just be present to it.There’s also a small opportunity to see my cousin along the way.We don’t talk often, but I do like him. It’s one of those optional threads — one I don’t need to force, but could be nice to follow if it feels good in the moment.And I guess that’s the theme now: not forcing anything.Not intensity.Not isolation.Not even healing.Just letting this trip be what it is. A gentle return to myself.A deepening of trust — in me, in my van, in life.And maybe that’s the real adventure after all."

I’m not leaving.”The kind that doesn’t disappear when I stop performing or pleasing or holding everything together.I think that’s what I’ve been grieving — not the total absence of love, but the absence of love that lasts.And when I’ve brushed up against it — something that might have been real — I’ve pushed it away.Because it felt unfamiliar.Dangerous, even.Like my body didn’t know how to let it in.That’s not my fault.It’s what happens when love is paired with inconsistency, control, or silence for too long.The system gets confused.Safety starts to feel suspicious.And now I find myself trying to redefine what love even means.Not based on what I was told.Not based on what I begged for.But based on what I need now.Maybe love is:  Respect, without performance.  Curiosity, without judgment.  Presence, without pressure.  Steadiness, without conditions.Maybe it doesn’t have to be dramatic or all-consuming.Maybe it’s quiet.Maybe it grows slowly.Maybe I’ve missed it sometimes because I was looking for the wrong signs.And maybe — just maybe — I’m not as far from it as I thought.Because I’m starting to let in my own care.My own reflection.My own truth.And that might be the first kind of love that actually stays."

Something scared.My inner child, maybe. The part of me that never got to be like that.The part that was neglected, rejected, emotionally starved.Now I see what I missed.

My son.And yes, I’m aware of how dangerous that could become — how easy it would be to lean on him emotionally, to let him become the one who fills the void.But I won’t do that. I don’t want anything from him.I just notice what it does to me.On Father’s Day, he gave me loads of gifts. Thoughtful, sweet, completely unnecessary — and yet I’ve never felt so loved.And I told him today: sometimes I’ve been sad, and it’s not his job to cheer me up. I hope he understood. I think he did.He said, “You always say that.”And maybe he’s right.But I am getting stronger.It’s just taken time — because I’ve had to face the truth underneath it all:  That I’ve never been consistently loved…Until now.And that it came from my child.That’s beautiful.And it’s devastating.Because he shouldn’t have to be the first.But the fact that he is… it means everything.Maybe the exhaustion isn’t about parenting.Maybe it’s about how close I am — for the first time — to the kind of love I never knew.And how much of me it takes to let it in without falling apart.I’m learning.And I’m staying."

      "content": "There’s a voice in my head — the critical parent — that still whispers I’ll lose it all. That poker’s not real, not safe, not worthy. That the money doesn’t count. That I’ll end up alone and broke, and maybe that’s what I deserve.But the facts say otherwise.My results are clear. My resilience is clearer. And most importantly, I finally know why I’m doing this.The Dream That Saved MeWhen I started playing poker as a teenager, it wasn’t just a game — it was freedom. It gave me a sense of control over my destiny that I never felt in my childhood. I believed — truly — that if I studied hard enough, if I played well enough, I could escape the cage I was born into.And so I studied relentlessly. I was miles ahead of others my age. Not because I was naturally better — but because I needed it more. It was my hope. My way out.The Years I Walked AwayI stopped playing for many years.On the surface, I left poker to pursue stability — for my son, for my ex-partner, for our life together. But underneath that, there was shame. There were voices — my mother, my partner, her family — saying it wasn’t real. That it wasn’t respectable. That it wasn’t enough.Even when I made more money in a single week than others did in a year, it didn’t feel like I was allowed to be proud. I felt disloyal for succeeding. I felt like every win pushed me further from the people I was still trying to please. And when you’re torn between your truth and your tribe, you often choose silence.So I sabotaged. I numbed. I played smaller. I made sure no one could say I had really “made it.”And I lived under the weight of an unspoken fear:If I truly succeed, I’ll be alone.The ReturnNow? Now it’s different.I play poker for fun. I play because I love it. And somehow, that’s made me more profitable than I’ve ever been. I don’t grind endlessly anymore. I play when I’m regulated, rested, aligned. I play when it feels right. And it works.There’s no pressure now. No one’s voice in my ear. No one to betray. No one to shrink for.I’m not playing to escape. I’m not playing to prove anything. I’m playing because it’s part of who I am — and it always has been.The IntegrationIt all makes sense now in retrospect.I spent years running businesses, helping kids through skating, building websites for clients, volunteering, learning to counsel — because I wanted my life to mean something. And now, somehow, all of it is weaving together.I can make money doing something I’d happily do for free. I can help people express themselves through websites like I did. I can sit with people in pain as I train to become a counselor. And I can show up as a father, honestly, not hiding or pretending anymore.Poker was never the problem. Hiding it was.The Man I Am NowThere’s still grief. Grief for the years I stepped away. Grief for the self I dimmed. But there’s also acceptance. And something even stronger:Belief.I believe in my skill. I believe in my resilience. I believe in who I am now.If my son ever wanted to play poker one day, I wouldn’t push him in or pull him out. I’d just be there — steady, honest, grounded. And that, for me, says everything.I used to feel like I cheated life.Now I see it differently:I just finally stopped cheating myself.My Poker ProgressHere’s a snapshot of my staking performance over the past few months—a visual reminder of how emotional regulation and self-trust pay off in practice:  "

And it’s okay to feel how much it hurt.”Because I won’t abandon myself anymore — not to make other people comfortable, and not to protect an old story that never served me.This was my life.And now, finally, I get to live the next part differently."

      "content": "For a while, I felt a quiet shame about being drawn to my therapist. I thought it was romantic attraction — maybe even something inappropriate. But when we explored it, I realised it wasn’t really about romance. It was about care. She showed a level of attunement I hadn’t felt in a long time — or maybe ever. And my body didn’t know how to file it. So it filed it under “attraction.”I remember feeling something similar with a girl at college. She gave me some small gifts, a little sense of safety — and I started building a future with her in my head. She had kids. I imagined stepping into that life. Not because I truly wanted it, but because a part of me was starved. Starved of emotional safety, of being met. And when someone gave me even a fraction of it, I mistook it for something deeper.Maybe I was attracted to her character. Maybe not so much her physically. But it felt worth exploring. And I’ve started to see that there’s no shame in that. I was trying to meet a need. That’s not shameful — it’s human.Lately I’ve noticed something else: when I analyse before I feel, I get confused. I intellectualise. I loop. But when I let myself feel first, and then gently reflect on it, things make more sense. That order matters. Feel → then analyse. Not the other way around.I don’t need to be ashamed of seeking safety. I don’t need to punish myself for moments of longing or projection. They’re just signals. They tell me what I need. And they’re leading me — slowly, awkwardly — toward something more secure, more real, and more mutual.It’s not about finding the perfect person. It’s about learning what safety actually feels like… and trusting that I’ll recognise the difference between survival bonds and true connection — when it comes."

Without thinking. Even though I knew it was Thursday. My whole sense of certainty just collapsed.And it wasn’t the first time.She did it again later that week, and something in me pushed back. Not outwardly. Just internally. I paused. I checked. I realized — no, it’s Wednesday. And this tiny moment made something in me stir.Why did I default to her reality over mine?I don’t think she meant anything by it. In fact, part of me wonders if she did know — if she was subtly noticing where my triggers live, how quick I am to surrender my perception when I feel someone has power over me. Because she’s been open. And kind. And honest. And I feel her love — not in a romantic way, just as mutual recognition. Like we see each other.It reminded me of something else. A moment with my tutor. She made a casual comment — “It’s a bit odd to check your watch for your energy.” And instead of laughing or brushing it off, I defended myself. Explained myself. I told her it was training wheels. That I’ve had trouble feeling my feelings. That I’m learning.But I didn’t need to do that. Not really.What I’m seeing is this: when I’m around women I perceive to be in power, something ancient gets triggered. I default to their version of reality. I abandon my own truth. And I feel the need to justify even the gentlest things — as if being misunderstood is somehow dangerous.That’s not about them.It’s about what was modeled for me. It’s about the subtle, slow erosion of self-trust over years of walking on eggshells. Years of needing someone else’s approval to feel safe.And what’s beautiful — what’s healing — is that I think these women see it. I think they know. And they’re not reacting. They’re not punishing me for it. They’re just… witnessing. Holding the space.It’s giving me space to notice it too.And maybe next time I’ll pause and say, “Yeah, it is a little odd.”And not feel the need to explain it away.Maybe this is how healing actually happens — not through grand revelations, but in tiny moments where we stay in our own body and let our truth stay standing."

But I’m beginning to trust that I’ll be okay whatever happens.I’m also realizing now how loyalty to my mother has denied me so many situations in life where people were actually looking out for me — people who tried to help, not hurt. And yet, I was drip-fed a version of events that made them out to be the bad guys. It happened with the man who did my kitchen and bathroom. It happened with my father.Looking back, I can see it more clearly: my mum may have projected her wounds onto that man. I was gaining independence. I was moving away. It was a year after my father died. Maybe she felt threatened. Alone. And so she spun a narrative. Subtly. Gently. But powerfully.The truth is — that man did a great job for the money I paid him. And I didn’t see that until years later. Seven or eight years have passed, and his work has quietly stood the test of time. It’s like a gentle, lasting love. No fanfare. Just honest integrity. The kind that reveals itself slowly.Maybe it wasn’t entirely intentional. Maybe it was. But I do believe he, and his son (who was my mate at the time), genuinely wanted to help me. And I couldn’t believe that back then. Not because of them — but because of what I’d been conditioned to believe. Because my mother’s version of events overtook my own.I have to be kind to myself about that.I was under so much pressure. Fresh out of hospital. My son in another country. Trying to start a business. Trying to survive. I didn’t have the bandwidth to question everything. And in that chaos, I let someone else take the reins. I let her dictate my thinking. It felt easier — safer — to let her lead.But that vulnerability… it was exploited. Not obviously. Not violently. But subtly. To meet her own needs. To gain back power.And that’s just… really sad. Really, really sad.But the fact that I can see it now — that I can say that’s what happened — means I’m no longer in it. I’m no longer under it. I’m reclaiming my own perception.And maybe that’s the quietest, strongest act of healing there is."

And the dog who curled by my side, who didn’t ask for anything but presence.At the time, I couldn’t hold it.It didn’t reach me.Not because they didn’t mean it,but because I didn’t know how to let the love in.When you’ve spent years armoured up—protecting what’s soft, hiding what’s been hurt—love can feel dangerous. Kindness feels suspicious. Support feels unfamiliar. And so I turned away, sometimes subtly, sometimes sharply. I didn’t reply. I joked instead of feeling. I shut the door before anyone could get close enough to see how much I wanted them to stay.There is grief in that.The grief of all the love that came and couldn’t land.The people who tried. The moments that passed.The connection I craved but didn’t know how to accept.But grief is a strange kind of teacher. It doesn’t just show you what you missed—it shows you what’s possible now.Because even though I couldn’t take it in then…I’m learning to now.I’m learning that love isn’t just about the big declarations. It’s the way someone says “text me when you’re home.” It’s remembering how you take your tea. It’s someone sitting with you in silence, not trying to fix anything.I’m learning to notice.To pause.To soften.And slowly, I’m letting it in.Not perfectly. Not all at once.

In fact, when they meet, that’s where real power lives.That’s what led to this moment the other week, when I knocked on my neighbour’s door around 11 pm. He’d been loud—again—on a school night, and my son needed sleep. So did I. I wasn’t aggressive, I wasn’t rude. I just knocked, calmly, and waited to speak to him. But instead of coming to the door, he opened his upstairs window and started shouting down.He didn’t want conversation.He wanted power.He wanted to rattle me.He said I shouldn’t be knocking at that time—even though it was his noise that had woken the house. He brought up my dog barking during the daytime as a reason I had no right to speak up. And then he told me that next time my dog barks, he’ll come round and fight me.That’s when I laughed.Because what he didn’t realise is that the part of me that used to be afraid in moments like this is no longer running the show.I’m not here to throw fists over petty neighbour disputes. But I’ve trained in jiu-jitsu for years. I’ve gone toe-to-toe with men bigger and stronger than me. I know what I’m capable of. I know that if someone genuinely threatens me or enters my space, I won’t freeze—I’ll respond. I’ll do what needs to be done. And honestly? I’d more than oblige.Not because I’m violent. But because I’m not scared of that side of myself anymore.For years, I buried it. I played nice. I avoided conflict at all costs. Even in rugby, where I thrived, I didn’t fully own that fire inside me. But jiu-jitsu changed that. It showed me how to harness power without ego. It brought out a grounded kind of strength—calm, alert, aware.So when my neighbour shouted down from the window—half my weight, pushing 60, puffing himself up with empty threats—I didn’t flinch. Because underneath the absurdity of the moment, I could see the truth: he thought I was weak because I was calm.But calm doesn’t mean powerless.Kind doesn’t mean passive.Soft doesn’t mean unsafe.And in that moment, I realised something important.What I used to call weakness—my empathy, my gentleness, my restraint—wasn’t weakness at all. It was strength in a deeper form.Real strength is knowing you can hurt someone—but choosing not to.Real strength is knocking on a door to protect your child’s sleep, not to protect your pride.Real strength is laughing at empty threats because you know exactly who you are, and you don’t need to prove it.I don’t go looking for fights. And I’d never start one. But if someone ever tried to bring one to my doorstep—truly—I’d meet it with full presence. Not from rage. Not from wounded pride. From clarity.That clarity, I think, is the part that scared him the most.Because when a man stands calmly in his centre, no longer performing toughness, but truly knowing his edges—that’s unnerving for those who only know how to bark.So maybe this blog isn’t about a petty neighbour dispute after all. Maybe it’s about me finally seeing that the softness I used to hide—the softness I used to hate—is actually my greatest strength.Because it’s not softness or strength.It’s both.Alive in me.Together."

Something familiar.For me, it was the urge to watch porn.And not just out of habit. Not out of boredom.But as a kind of unconscious balancer—like my system was trying to stabilize the unfamiliar intensity of being cared for, of being witnessed.That part of me—the one that reaches for instant, controlled intimacy—didn’t disappear just because I’ve grown.It showed up after the growth.And that’s what struck me.Sometimes, even when our deepest unmet needs are finally touched, our body doesn’t know what to do with it.It’s too new. Too unfamiliar.So we reach—almost reflexively—for what we’ve always known:Something fast. Something numbing. Something that gives the illusion of closeness without the vulnerability.In that moment, I didn’t act on the urge.But I did notice it.I messaged someone. I considered it.But I paused. I reflected. I didn’t shame myself.That pause—that ability to sit with the urge, to explore its message without obeying it—is where the healing lives.  Growth doesn’t always feel like peace.Sometimes it feels like discomfort, because your system is trying to rewrite its response to connection.And it’s okay if old urges resurface after big moments of healing.It doesn’t mean you’ve regressed.It means your body is integrating—recalibrating what safety feels like now.I’m learning that the goal isn’t to erase all my impulses.It’s to get curious about them.To ask, “What are you trying to protect? What are you trying to soothe?”And to offer something better—even if it’s just the choice to pause and notice."

      "content": "It’s strange to think that just a week ago, I was sitting in therapy, holding the ache of not feeling truly loved by my father.That deep, quiet loneliness. The kind that isn’t always loud in your mind, but lives in your bones. The kind that made me feel, even as a child, like I had to take care of myself. Protect myself. Be the strong one.And now, only a few days later, I’m here — reflecting on strength, my body, boundaries, and what it means to let go of old protection strategies that no longer serve me.It might seem like a completely different focus. But it’s not.It’s the same wound, just showing itself in a new light.It’s all interwoven.There’s a part of me that learned early on that emotional safety was unreliable — that I couldn’t rely on tenderness, presence, or being held. So instead, I turned to something I could control: my body.Mass. Strength. Power.If no one could protect me, then I would become the protector.If no one made me feel safe, then I would make myself untouchable.And it worked — to an extent.I did get stronger. I trained. I became capable of defending myself.But under it all, the loneliness was still there.What’s been shifting recently is that I don’t feel the need to prove my strength anymore. I know it’s there. I trust it. I feel it in my body — especially when I’m met with disrespect or boundary violations. I know I’ll act in alignment. I know I’ll protect myself or those I love. It’s become natural.But I’ve also started to notice that I might be holding onto some of this size, this weight, as a lingering relic of that past. Not consciously. But maybe as a kind of emotional armour.Because being physically big made me feel safe.And in a world where I didn’t always feel loved, safe was the next best thing.That’s the beauty of doing this work — it’s not linear. It loops.One week I’m grieving my father’s absence.The next I’m celebrating the man I’ve become in response to that absence.And somewhere in between, I’m learning how to let go of what I no longer need — without shame, and without rushing.I’m not sure I need to be “strong” in the same way anymore.Not because strength is bad, but because I no longer need to earn my worth through it.Not because I’m letting go of protection, but because I trust myself to show up if I ever need to.This week has been a weaving of old threads:Loneliness. Strength. Softness. Shame.But the difference is — this time, I didn’t weave them alone.My therapist’s presence helped me hold it all.And even outside the room, I held it with myself.With blogs. With breath. With awareness.That’s integration.That’s healing.And it doesn’t always feel like a breakthrough.Sometimes, it just feels like coming home."

      "content": "Something extraordinary happened in therapy today.A part of me came forward — a part I’ve kept so hidden, it was almost underground. Not because I was ashamed of it. But because the world around me had no space for it. No understanding. No welcome.It’s a part of me that’s joyful. Enthusiastic. Bright.Fast-talking, curious, connected.Alive.And today, I let it be seen.Fully.And it was accepted.It might sound small, but it wasn’t.It was probably the most healing experience I’ve ever had.Because this part of me — this vibrant, emotionally intelligent, expressive version of me — is the same one that others have labeled manic. Or questioned. Or quietly judged.Not because it’s disordered — but because it unsettled people who couldn’t meet it.Some couldn’t understand that joy doesn’t have to mean chaos.That high energy doesn’t always mean instability.That my aliveness isn’t dangerous.Growing up, I was told my sensitivity was too much.That I should go cry in my room, and come back when I was “sorted.”That joy should be toned down.That depth was inconvenient.So I learned to split off the parts of myself that felt the most natural.To keep them hidden unless it was absolutely safe.But today — in that room — I didn’t hide.I’ve shown glimpses of this part to a few people before. And sometimes, they’ve embraced it. Other times, they’ve shut it down — even pathologized it. As if my joy somehow made them uncomfortable. As if the brightness I carried shone too much light on their shadows.But here’s what I’m realizing:  My joy is not a threat. My sensitivity is not a flaw. My emotional range is not a liability.This is what integration feels like.Not mania. Not instability. Just… me.Whole. Awake. Expressive.And yes, I may be quicker than most.Yes, my thoughts might come fast.Yes, I might connect ideas that others miss.But that’s not something to apologise for.That’s something to honour.Because I’ve carried enough shame in my life.I’ve lost enough time trying to shape myself into something more “acceptable.”I don’t want to dim anymore — especially not when I’m finally enjoying life.If you want to call it manic, that’s your lens.But I know what this is: joy.The kind of joy that emerges when all the fragments of you finally sit at the same table.The kind of joy that doesn’t need to be explained — only embraced.And if someone can’t meet me in this state, that’s okay.They don’t have to.I’ll meet myself here.Fully. Proudly. Tenderly.Because this part of me — the one I was told to hide —might just be the best part of all."

      "content": "There’s a peace in knowing I don’t need to do everything at once anymore.I used to leap into projects reactively — slapping decking down in survival mode, chasing instant progress, trying to outrun the discomfort of standing still. But now? I can feel a shift. I’ve slowed down enough to listen. And the answer that’s been coming up lately is simple:The garden can wait.The house comes first.It’s not that the garden isn’t important — it is.It’s a place I want to reclaim. A space that could become deeply nourishing, peaceful, and creative. But this time, I’m not just reacting. I’m building for the next 20 years, not just the next two weeks. And that means letting it marinate.I want the plan to unfold gently. I want to consider the light, the flow, the dog, the fence, the way ivy grows and where I’ll hang the hammock. I want to build something that grows with me — not something I outgrow in a season.So I’m giving myself permission to wait.🏡 Focus Now: The HouseRight now, the house is asking for my energy.That’s where the next layer of groundedness will come from.Not just in layout or aesthetics — but in how the space holds me, reflects me, and supports me day-to-day.Once that’s anchored — once I feel at home in every corner — the garden will follow. Naturally. Organically. Almost like a plant taking root once the soil is ready.🌿 The Garden Plan (for Spring 2026 and Beyond)While I work on the house, the garden vision can simmer. And I’ll keep refining it as it does:  Build a light-filled, partially enclosed work area on the concrete base  Dismantle and reuse shed parts for storage integration  Reclaim the gravel path space with grass and low-maintenance planting  Replace fencing with modern strip panels and trellis for privacy  Grow ivy and vines to soften the space  Design raised planters to keep them dog-proof  Create a hammock or cozy seating zone tucked away in a sun trap  Install soft lighting for evenings — fairy lights, solar LEDs  Move the rainwater collector and re-integrate it into the structureIt doesn’t all need to happen at once. In fact, I don’t want it to.🔨 Why This Time is DifferentThe biggest change isn’t the plan — it’s me.I no longer need quick wins to feel good.I trust the process. I trust myself.I’ve already done the hardest parts:  Replacing the ancient paving with fresh concrete  Building things with limited resources and limited energy  Learning from what I rushed, and what I’d do differentlyNow it’s about working with what I’ve got — not ripping everything out, but gently reshaping what’s already here. Honouring what served me, and letting it evolve with more care.And I’m proud of that.This space — both inside and out — is becoming my own.It won’t happen overnight.But it will happen.Because I’m not rushing anymore.I’m building a home."

And yet… it doesn’t feel tragic. It doesn’t even feel particularly sad.Because I have something else.I have my purpose.I have my son.I have enough connection in my life to make it meaningful.And I have me.That used to feel like a backup plan. Now, it feels like the centrepiece.Everything else is a bonus.And there’s a beauty in that.I’m not afraid to start again—financially, socially, emotionally. Even if I lost what little connection I currently have, I think I’d be okay. Health matters. Sanity matters. And I know those things can waver.But what feels most important is this:As long as I can return to myself—to my sense of who I am,to the good, the bad, the ugly—I’ll be okay.Because that relationship, the one I have with myself, is real now.

      "content": "Where do I still equate softness with weakness?Am I able to stay open without bracing?I think, subconsciously, the answer is still yes—there are parts of me that equate being soft with being unsafe.Especially when someone’s pushing my boundaries.Especially when they’re in a child-like, reactive state—testing limits, trying to provoke.One moment stands out.A neighbour came banging on my window because my dog was barking.His dog barks all the time, and this wasn’t really about noise—it was about the way he handled it. It felt intrusive, disrespectful, and aggressive.And I responded with,“Yeah, fair enough. I see why you’re annoyed.”At the time, I thought I was being weak.Too soft. Too forgiving.And I think he perceived it that way too—like he could do it again.There was this sting of shame afterwards.Like I’d lost something.Like I didn’t stand up for myself.But now—months later—I’m realising something deeper.That wasn’t weakness.That was strength.It took a tremendous amount of inner control not to explode.Not to lash out.Not to mirror his aggression.If I’m honest, my shadow wanted to crack his head open.I wanted to shout. To scare. To make him back down.But I didn’t.I stayed present.I held space.I tried to respond with perspective—not emotion.And even if it wasn’t the right call for him,even if he didn’t deserve that grace,that choice was a reflection of my strength—not a failure of it.What I’m learning now is this:The strength isn’t in how someone responds to the space I offer—it’s in my capacity to offer it in the first place.Would I do it the same way again?Not exactly.He’s shown he doesn’t respect that kind of opening.And I’ve learned from that.But my intention—to preserve the relationship, to stay grounded, to hold space for a neighbour I’ll likely share proximity with for years to come—was rooted in long-term thinking.In emotional maturity.In presence.Softness didn’t mean passivity.It meant restraint.It meant I saw the bigger picture, even when I wanted to shrink it down to one moment of rage.That, to me now, is strength.And I think I’m finally learning to see how strong I’ve been—in all the places I used to think I was weak."

I ate a little. I laced up.And I ran.It wasn’t fast. It wasn’t about pushing. It was a 45-minute jog at Zone 2, with a few moments dipping into Zone 3. Enough to get my blood moving, but not enough to tip me into exhaustion. When I checked my watch after, I saw I’d only used 6–7% of my body battery. That small detail felt like a win — a sign that I’d hit the sweet spot.It was the right decision.Sometimes it won’t be.But this time, it was.There’s something about movement that doesn’t just regulate the body — it resets the mind.

I kept a wide concrete space clear for skating, holding onto a dream that no longer quite fits. Skating’s still part of my story, but it’s not where I find my aliveness now. And preserving space for a version of myself that’s no longer present just doesn’t make sense anymore.That’s where the shift began.I started imagining a structure — something like a garage, but not really. A covered space, open on one side, maybe with a transparent roof to let light in. A place I could work on creative projects even when it rains. A little sanctuary tucked between walls, partly protected already by the layout of the garden itself.I don’t need it to last 50 years. I just want it to feel like mine.And then it kept unfolding.That gravel path I laid — it doesn’t feel necessary anymore. It overcomplicates the space. I could reclaim that area. Move the current shed. Repurpose its materials. Merge storage and creativity into one covered workshop. Suddenly, I see the potential:  More grass growing freely.  Plants along the right-hand fence.  Space that breathes again.And not just physically — emotionally too.Because this is what reclaiming space really means:Letting go of old versions of myself, and building for the one that’s here now.Not the man who needed to stay busy to avoid stillness.Not the boy who needed strength to feel safe.But the man who wants to sit in his garden and feel nourished.To create, to slow down, to be in it.It doesn’t need to be grand.It just needs to feel like home.This is what’s next — after the van is finished, after I’ve put all that energy into movement and mobility.Now, I want something rooted.Something still.Something that invites me to stay.I’m not in survival anymore.And maybe it’s time my garden stopped surviving too —and started growing."

I’m aware. I’m more me than I’ve ever been.And with that comes the question:What does power look like when I’m not defending myself anymore?I think part of me is still afraid to fully own my strength.Not because I don’t trust it—but because I’m afraid of how it might be received.There’s this lingering fear that my full presence—my clarity, my confidence, my depth—might be “too much.”Too intense. Too honest. Too… real.I’ve seen people flinch when I’m fully present.Not because I’m trying to intimidate—but because I’ve spent so long carrying that survivor’s energy.The edge. The readiness. The weight.It’s softened now. But still—there’s that voice that says,“Tone it down. Don’t make them uncomfortable.”And underneath that, I’m still unlearning the old belief that softness is weakness.That being gentle will get you hurt.That opening your heart will be used against you.Intellectually, I know that’s not true anymore.But my body still remembers otherwise.Still braces.Yet something is shifting.I’m beginning to see that real power isn’t loud. It doesn’t need to prove anything.Real power can cry. Can pause. Can stay present without collapsing.Softness isn’t the absence of strength.It’s what happens after strength has nothing left to prove.I’ve also started becoming more intentional about who gets access to my power.In the past, I gave it away too easily.I let people close who hadn’t earned it—because I was starving for connection.I handed out depth in places that couldn’t hold it.But now?If someone can’t meet me with equal presence, care, and honesty, I don’t offer the same depth.Not out of coldness—out of self-respect.Not everyone gets all of me.And that boundary is power, too.So now I’m sitting with this:Letting power be presence, not protection.Letting it be the quiet steadiness I carry when I walk into a room,not because I need to defend myself—but because I’m grounded.Because I’m here.No performance. No mask.Just me—without the armour.And that…That feels like a new kind of strength."

The constant news-watching, the catastrophizing, the sense that peace must be earned through suffering. That energy lived in my home growing up.But now? There’s another voice emerging.A gentler one. A wiser one.It tells me:There are more people out there than I think.More women who’ve found peace in themselves.More women who don’t want to settle either.More women who would love someone who is emotionally available, financially stable, physically grounded, and family-oriented.And I realise—I’m rare in that way.I care.I listen.I protect.And I leave when I’m not met.I don’t need perfect.I just need someone willing to co-create something real.Something better than solitude.And that’s the thing—I love solitude.It’s where I heal, where I grow, where I feel most like myself.So anyone who steps into my life has to be sweeter than solitude.Not louder.Not flashier.Just… deeper.And I’m not worried.Because now I know—connection won’t come from pushing.It will come from living.

I was walking around with an invisible wound that no one could see, and Jiu-Jitsu became the only space where I could let anything out.But not in words.Not in tears.Through strength.Every grapple, every explosive movement, every moment I refused to quit—I wasn’t just fighting an opponent. I was expressing grief.It was all I had.I think now, in hindsight, I wasn’t being defensive.I was trying to stay intact.To feel something solid beneath me when everything else had fallen apart.And in a strange way, bringing my full physical power to the mat was my way of saying:“This is what’s left of me. And I’m not letting go.”That wasn’t aggression.That was grief.That was me holding the pieces of myself together the only way I knew how.So yes—Strength was my grief.And I honour it now.Not because I need to live that way anymore,but because it got me here."

But the desire to travel, to spend an evening chasing surface-level connection, or risk my body for a feeling that doesn’t land anymore… it’s just not there. The exchange no longer feels worth it.And I think I understand why. I’ve felt real connection now—in counselling rooms, on quiet dog walks, in fleeting but genuine moments with strangers. And that’s changed everything.Skating gave me access to something I needed at the time. A feeling of belonging. A way to connect. But now, I need more. Not more stimulation—more depth.I don’t want to give my energy away just to feel less alone. I want presence. Reciprocity. Conversations that hold weight. And if that’s not there, I’m more than okay being alone.It feels like I’ve quietly retired. Not with a dramatic goodbye, but with a soft letting go. A chapter closing on its own.And maybe the most beautiful part?I no longer have to risk my body to feel alive.I no longer have to chase the past.I can just… be here.

Grounded. Kind. Clear.Yesterday I met with a new young person I’m supporting through Barnardo’s.People had warned me he might not open the door.That he might disappear after five minutes.That he’s “difficult.”But none of that happened.We sat together for nearly 45 minutes.Just chatting.Nothing profound, nothing forced.Just the two of us, the dog, and some shared space.And it was enough.I wasn’t trying to extract anything from the moment.I wasn’t performing.I just met him where he was—and trusted that was enough.That’s what all this inner work has given me:The ability to walk into spaces with less anxiety.To lead with presence instead of performance.To trust that if I’m attuned, if I’m clear in my intention,the outcome will most likely take care of itself.Because the healing is no longer just inside me.It’s starting to ripple out—in eye contact, in gentleness, in silence, in a quiet 45 minutes that might have meant more than it seemed.And that’s something I’m proud of."

I’ll pitter-patter around the house—slowly making things a little more “me,” a little more tidy. I’ll take moments of rest when I feel them calling. Maybe I’ll go for a run later. Maybe I won’t. I’ll just feel into it.There’s a kind of peace in not pushing. In not trying to extract productivity or connection from every hour. Just being in the flow of what’s true.What’s interesting is that I’m not chasing connection anymore. And I’m not lonely. I’m genuinely happy in my own company. There’s a small, whispering fear underneath that maybe I should be putting in more effort to make connections happen. But I don’t think that’s the right path—not for me.Because when my cup is full, I connect more easily anyway.Not because I’m trying, but because I’m being.So I’m letting go of the old strategy—forcing myself to go places or be around people in hopes of manufacturing connection. That’s never quite worked.Instead, I’ll focus on building something beautiful from the inside out.Tending to my metaphorical garden.Letting it bloom with honesty, softness, peace.And if someone ever walks into that garden—not because I chased them,but because they wandered in and felt something real—they might just look around and think:“This is lovely. I think I’ll stay.”"

And today, something’s starting to land in my body:I did it.I’ve removed every draining presence from my life.The people who chipped away at my self-worth, the ones who expected everything and gave very little — they’re gone.And now, all of that energy I used to spend managing dysfunction…I get to give it to myself. And to my son.That’s the most self-loving thing I’ve ever done.And I’m still letting it sink in.I’ve also reached for support when I needed it — through therapy, through reflection, through honest expression. I didn’t try to do it all alone. And that, too, is something I’m embracing.I’m following a path that actually fits me — studying counselling, working with Barnardo’s, connecting with people in a way that feels aligned with who I am and who I’m becoming. I’m certain this is the direction I’m meant to go. Even if the road isn’t linear. Even if I don’t get into Level 4 this time. I’ll regroup. I’ll adapt. And I’ll try again.Because the end goal isn’t in question — only the route.I’ve even created a source of income that I once doubted — through poker. A field that requires discipline, intuition, strategy, emotional regulation — and I’m growing in all of it. I’ve made solid progress. And even though part of me resists celebrating it, I know I’ve earned every step. I’ve taken time off to process emotionally, and still, I’m moving forward. I trust that will only continue to build.Most importantly: I’m secure.Financially — I’m supported enough to focus on becoming who I want to be without panic.Emotionally — I feel stability in a way I never have before.Socially — I might not have the most vibrant social life right now, but I’m not as far off as I sometimes think. A meaningful conversation a day — that’s often all I really need.And as for love — I do want a partner one day. But I’m no longer waiting to build my life around someone else.I’m building the kind of life that welcomes love in — not one that clings to it.A life where someone would want to stay because it feels like home.And if they didn’t want to?That would be okay too.Because I’m still going to have a beautiful life.What I’m learning is that freedom doesn’t always feel loud.Sometimes it’s quiet. Grounded. Soft.Like sitting still and realising — finally — I’m here.I’m okay.And I’m in charge of what happens next."

Sometimes even welcome it. It made me feel needed. Important.But I didn’t see the cost.Because the longer I stayed in that role, the more I had to abandon myself.My joy.My spontaneity.My own needs.It was never equal.It was never sustainable.And it always ended the same way:With me drained, disconnected, and doubting myself.But not anymore.Now, I feel it instantly.I feel the shift in my nervous system — the moment I’m being asked to hold more than I should.And I correct it. Naturally. Calmly. Without needing to prove anything.I stay in Adult.And if the other person can’t meet me there — I step back.Not out of punishment, but out of self-respect.That’s growth.Not something theoretical.Not a nice idea I’m hoping to implement one day.It’s happening moment by moment.And that’s something no critical voice inside me can take away.Because it’s not based in ego — it’s based in evidence.Lived proof.

But even that felt more like a survival instinct than something I’d call love.It’s not that I wish her harm. I don’t.But I’ve had to step away.For my son.For my peace.For the version of myself I’ve worked so hard to become.When she contacted me recently, asking to reconnect, I responded simply:“No. I’ll contact you if and when I feel ready.”It wasn’t an act of cruelty. It was an act of clarity.Of self-respect.Of protection.To be honest, I don’t know if I’ll ever feel ready.And I don’t owe certainty.What I do owe — to myself and my son — is safety.The truth is, part of me has grieved that it may never happen.That the kind of relationship I used to long for — built on understanding, respect, accountability — may never come to be.But there’s also a quiet part in me that says:If that day ever comes — a day of genuine change, real help, and lasting honesty — I’ll know what to do when I feel it.Until then, I need space.Not from a place of punishment, but from presence.From a life that no longer centers pain.There’s no anger here.Just distance.And maybe, in a strange way, that’s a form of love too.The kind that says:  “I won’t pretend, but I also won’t fight.

      "content": "For so long, I thought my strength lived in my size. In my mass. In how physically “intimidating” I appeared. It made sense back then. In childhood, safety meant being bigger, louder, harder to mess with. It meant occupying space so no one could take it from me.But I’ve been noticing something lately.That belief is slowly softening.The weight I’ve been carrying — not just emotionally, but literally — might have done its job.And maybe… I don’t need it anymore.I’ve been reflecting on why I still overeat sometimes. Part of it, sure, is comfort. It’s regulation. It’s that warm, immediate relief from emotional tension. But underneath that, I wonder if there’s something else — a subconscious drive to maintain my size as a form of safety.Because when I’m heavier, I’m stronger.And when I’m stronger, I’m safer.At least that’s the logic that once kept me alive.But now? Now I trust my body.Truly.Deeply.Consistently.I can feel it — in those moments when I need to stand up for myself, set a boundary, or speak my truth. It rises in me like a current. There’s no panic. No indecision. Just a knowing. A presence that says: “It’s time.” And I act. Not from rage. Not from fear. But from alignment.That wasn’t always true. It took years of rewiring, of practice, of learning to stay in my body when things got uncomfortable. But these days, I don’t have to think about it — it just happens. It’s become who I am.I’m proud of that.I haven’t acted out of alignment in a very long time.And when I look back, there’s nothing I carry shame over. Nothing I’d take back.That’s a rare kind of peace.But something else is happening too.I’ve been running more. Moving differently. And I’ve started to wonder if maybe… I don’t need to be as physically strong anymore. Not because strength is bad — but because I no longer need to prove it. The part of me that once clung to that image is quieting. Not gone, but softening.There might still be a wounded child part in me who holds onto the idea that bigger = safer. But I can hold him gently now. Let him know that he’s protected, not by sheer mass, but by the man he’s grown into. A man with trained instincts, with self-respect, with presence. A man who knows what he’s capable of — and doesn’t need to show it.I think I’m ready for my strength to take a new form.One that breathes.One that moves.One that runs freely through forests, rather than anchoring itself in armour.The body I’ve built got me here. It’s served its purpose. But it might not be the body I need for the next season of my life.And I’m okay with that.Because strength doesn’t always need to be heavy.Sometimes, it just needs to be real."

Yet when rare connections fade quietly, it leaves an ache—proof that authenticity matters, even in small-town spaces.”—There’s a strange atmosphere at my son’s football training. I can’t quite name it—maybe it’s the small-town closeness, the group dynamics, or just the way energy moves between people—but I always come away feeling a little off-centre.There are two women who coach the team. One of them, I’ve had a few good conversations with in the past, but lately she seems to keep a distance. Maybe because she’s married and doesn’t want anything to seem inappropriate, or maybe she’s just more guarded now. Either way, it feels like something shifted.The other coach is quieter—gruff, even—but I can tell there’s a softness underneath. She helped my son with a nosebleed once. I wasn’t sure if I should go onto the pitch to help, and maybe she didn’t like that. But yesterday, as we passed each other, I simply said, “Thank you.” She didn’t respond with words, but I felt she understood it. Underneath the avoiding eyes and awkwardness, I think she received the sentiment: I saw her effort, and I appreciated it.They don’t get paid. They show up every week. They’re kind to my son. That matters.It’s a weird space for me to inhabit. I’m probably not like most of the other parents there. I don’t perform “banter” well. I don’t enjoy surface-level chat for the sake of it. I’m happy to sit quietly on my own. I say hello. I offer warmth. But I don’t chase connection that drains me.And maybe that gets interpreted as arrogance. Maybe there’s a grain of truth in that—I’ve spent years learning to protect my energy. I’ve tried, genuinely, to connect with some of the people there, and each time I’ve walked away feeling depleted. It just reminds me of how few people I actually feel energized by.That’s what makes it hard when a connection I value seems to quietly fade. It hasn’t been officially named or confirmed, but there’s a distance now. One I can feel. And when those rare, meaningful connections grow quiet, it leaves a particular ache. Not loud—but present.Still, I trust that if I stay true to this path, I’ll be surprised—those rare connections do exist. They’re just not found everywhere.Like the woman I met during my college interview. We connected instantly. She was warm, grounded, present. I don’t know if it was intentional—whether my tutors thought we’d be a good match—but I felt it. And it reminded me: the kind of connection I value isn’t impossible. It’s just rare.Sometimes, I wonder if I read too much into things. But honestly, I think my assessments of these social dynamics are usually pretty accurate. I’m not projecting. I’m just aware.And that awareness isn’t a burden—it’s a compass.So I’ll keep showing up. Quietly. Authentically. Saying thank you when it matters. Trusting that, one day, someone will meet me in the same place I stand."

      "content": "Can I safely embody power now, without it being tied to a label?That question has been sitting with me lately.Because for most of my life, power was something I had to wear—to survive, to be taken seriously, to stay safe.It was something reactive. Defensive. A way of saying, “Don’t mess with me.”It came from pain, from chaos, from needing to control what couldn’t be controlled.But now I’m asking:What does power look like when I’m not defending myself?And the answer feels simple—but deep.It looks like presence.Not just any presence—but something grounded.Something calm.Something people feel more than see.A kind of energy that doesn’t need to posture, doesn’t need to react.It just is.Sometimes it feels masculine—strong, rooted, still.Sometimes it feels feminine—open, receptive, wise.Often it’s both.It’s in my body language.It’s in how I carry myself.It’s even in my heart rate—the way I stay calm in the face of tension, not because I’m numb, but because I trust myself now.That, to me, is true power.And when I really strip it down, I think the word that captures it best is this:Responsibility.To embody power is to take responsibility for how I respond.Not to control everything, but to meet whatever arises with presence.To hold steady.To stay connected to myself.That kind of power doesn’t need a label.It doesn’t need to be announced.It doesn’t even need to be explained.It’s just there—quietly shaping the room,because I’m finally rooted in who I am."

      "content": "There was something about that interaction that stuck with me longer than I expected. A girl I’d connected with — someone who had read all my blogs — had a strange, offbeat dynamic with me when we spoke in person. I went outside to talk with her, and what I felt in the moment was subtle but uncomfortable. She seemed dismissive. Not unkind, but distant. And something about it just wouldn’t leave me alone.At first, I tried to let it go. I’ve been moving away from over-theorizing lately, trying to trust my emotional experience without jumping into analysis. But something about this one kept gnawing at me. And in therapy, the clarity finally landed.She had put me in a role.Unconsciously, maybe — but it was there. Because she’d read so much of what I’d written, there was a sense that I held some kind of authority. And when she approached me, it didn’t feel like a grounded adult-to-adult exchange. It felt like she wanted something from me. Some care. Some reassurance. Some unconscious parenting.And I didn’t want to give it.Not because I’m unkind. But because I’ve played that role before — far too many times.1. Where else in my life have I been unconsciously placed in the ‘nurturing parent’ role?The dynamic with her echoed the same one I experienced with my ex-partner. And before that, with my mother. Both had a tendency to collapse into helplessness — to pull me into emotional labour that wasn’t mine to carry. To expect me to fix something in them without ever saying it out loud.Over time, I became fluent in rescuing. In emotional containment. In holding space that drained me.That’s why this moment stuck. It triggered that same old loop — and for the first time in a while, I noticed it in real time.2. What happens inside me when I feel someone wants to be rescued by me — emotionally or otherwise?I feel anger. A kind of psychic resistance. Exhaustion. Like I’m being pulled into something that looks like connection, but is actually entanglement.It’s subtle — not dramatic or overt — but I feel it in my nervous system. I feel the old urge to be helpful, to support, to “be good.” But I also feel the healthy part of me now saying: No. This isn’t mine to hold.3. How do I protect my boundaries while still being empathetic — without collapsing into old rescuer roles?The key is clarity and presence. I don’t need to overexplain. I don’t need to fix. I can stay in Adult mode — in Transactional Analysis terms — and not get pulled into Parent or Child roles.This time, I did that.I stayed grounded. I didn’t overextend.And even though I felt unresolved about the interaction for a while, I never compromised who I am now to appease the dynamic.That’s growth.4. Can I continue honouring what I feel first, before overlaying theory — and then use theory as a supportive lens rather than a primary one?Yes. This experience confirmed that.I felt the discomfort first.I sat with it.I tried not to label it prematurely.And then, when the theory came in — the Parent/Child/Adult framework — it didn’t explain it away, it simply named what I already knew deep down.That’s the order I want to work in now.Felt sense first.Then language.Not the other way around.Final Thought:What I’m learning is that not every emotional tangle needs to be solved with effort. Some of them just need to be seen clearly. Once I named the role I was being cast in, everything loosened.I don’t need to play the rescuer anymore.I don’t need to prove I’m kind by abandoning myself.I can let people carry their own discomfort.And I can walk away with peace."

Not as sharp.But still there in moments.The fear of being misunderstood.Of being seen wrongly.Of being read by people who never really looked at me in the first place—especially my mother, or others from my past who never made space for who I really was.The closer I get to my truth, the more distance I feel from those people.And in a strange way, that distance has been a gift.Because the more I step into my own voice, the more I see how little they ever heard me.If they read what I write now, they probably wouldn’t even recognise me in it.Because they never really saw me to begin with.And that realisation has softened the fear.It’s no longer a fear of being seen.It’s just the echo of a much older fear—of trying to explain myself to people who were never open to understanding.I don’t need to do that anymore.What matters now is this:The people who have read my words—just a few of them so far—have said they felt something.They connected.They resonated.And that makes it worth it.Even if it’s only 10 people. Even if it’s only one.Because writing like this isn’t just for others.It’s for me.To express what was once unspeakable.To give voice to the parts of myself no one held space for.And in doing so, to hold that space for myself.That is healing.That is power.And that is hope."

By the third repetition, it wasn’t about humour anymore—it was about power. A subtle attempt to undermine. The words may have worn a smile, but the energy behind them didn’t.And here’s what’s wild: it wasn’t loud. It wasn’t cruel. It was just off. And that’s all it needed to be. My body caught it before I did.The Deeper TruthLooking back, I think it was an unconscious move. I don’t believe she meant harm in the way we think of harm—more like a reflexive jab from someone who might be feeling small inside. Maybe on some level, she saw something in me—potential, presence, a calm she hasn’t yet found in herself—and that contrast made her uncomfortable.There’s a chance she once felt we were on the same page, and now the pages are turning faster for me. That can stir resentment in people, even when they genuinely like you. Even when you like them.I Used to Rescue HerIn past sessions, I found myself trying to rescue her from her emotions. And I think I did that because, deep down, I recognized her resistance. The discomfort. The buried parts she wasn’t ready to face—and maybe I used to do that too.Now I don’t. Now I just observe.I’ve stopped playing the role of emotional caretaker to people who aren’t doing the same for me. That doesn’t mean I’ve stopped caring. It just means I’ve started respecting my energy.Not Everyone Has to Understand YouSometimes, people won’t listen. Sometimes, they’ll deflect or make jabs. And sometimes, it’s because they’re fighting battles you’ve already begun to walk away from.You don’t have to stay and prove your worth.You don’t have to explain why the joke wasn’t funny.You just have to notice when something tightens in your chest, when your skin goes hot, when your feet move before your mind even catches up.That’s your boundary speaking.And it doesn’t owe anyone an explanation."

These experiences can loop, overlap, or reappear in waves. But knowing the terrain can help you feel less alone.1. 🌬️ Relief and SilenceWhat you may feel:  Space to breathe.  Nervous system calming.  A strange, almost guilty peace.Why it happens:You’re no longer walking on eggshells, defending yourself, or decoding manipulation.But be prepared:Relief can fade or flicker as deeper layers surface. That’s not regression — it’s part of the unfolding.2. 😞 Grief Over What Never WasWhat you may feel:  A longing for the parent or family you should have had.  A sense of injustice or heartbreak.Why it happens:You’re mourning a fantasy. The one you held onto — maybe for years — hoping they’d change.Now you’re letting it go. And that’s incredibly painful.3. 🫥 Identity ConfusionWhat you may feel:  “Who am I without them?”  A loss of structure or orientation.  Like you’re suddenly invisible.Why it happens:Your self-concept was shaped around pleasing them or surviving them. Now you get to rebuild your identity on your own terms — slowly, gently.4. 😣 Guilt and DoubtWhat you may feel:  “Maybe I was too harsh.”  “Am I the narcissist?”  Compulsive second-guessing.Why it happens:Narcissistic systems are built on guilt, shame, and self-doubt. Even after escape, their messages echo internally.  ✨ Remember: Guilt is not always a moral compass — sometimes it’s a trauma echo.5. 🧍 Profound LonelinessWhat you may feel:  Like an emotional orphan.  A yearning for belonging.  A lack of witnesses to your story.Why it happens:Family is supposed to be your safety net. And now it’s gone — or maybe it never really was.This stage is especially intense for those with no remaining family support.  🔑 This is where chosen family, therapy, creativity, and spiritual connection can begin to step in.6. 🌱 Post-Traumatic Growth (Slow Unfolding)What you may feel:  Moments of stillness.  Stronger boundaries.  A growing sense of self-respect.Why it happens:You’ve cleared space. And now healing has somewhere to land.You’re learning how to be with yourself without fear.This is where it starts to feel like you’re becoming your own parent.This is where real freedom begins.❤️ Other Things You Might Experience  Hypervigilance around intense or manipulative people  Triggers around door knocking, holidays, or certain phrases  Shame spirals when you feel “too much” or “not enough”  Dreams about your parent — sometimes comforting, sometimes distressing  Moments of empowerment that scare you because they feel unfamiliar🧡 A Reminder for the Lonely Days  You didn’t cut them off because you didn’t love them.You cut them off because you finally chose to love yourself more.If you’re reading this and you’re in it — I see you.If you’ve made this decision and feel like you’re unraveling — you’re not broken.You’re finally coming home to yourself.You don’t need to rush it.You’re allowed to rest.This healing is yours — and it will make space for everything they never gave you.One quiet, courageous moment at a time."

      "url": "/blog/what-does-strength-look-like-now/",
      "date": "June 12, 2025",
      "content": "There’s a version of me that was trained — conditioned — to soften.To make things okay for everyone else.To ease the tension in the room.To apologize, even for my own needs.And for a long time, I called that strength.Because it kept me safe. It kept the peace.But I’m seeing it now for what it was: survival.I’ve been watching, reading, and reflecting on Nietzsche’s ideas lately —not just the loud ones that get quoted to sound impressive,but the deeper, quieter invitations to discover our inner strength by becoming who we truly are.And I’ve been asking myself:What does strength look like for me now?🗿 Strength Is No Longer Being Who They Trained Me to Be  “Become who you are.” — NietzscheThey trained me to be small.Polite. Accommodating.To speak softly so others wouldn’t feel confronted by my truth.But I’m learning that I don’t have to explain myself in lowercase letters anymore.Strength, for me now, is no longer about keeping the room calm.It’s about staying rooted in myself — even if the room shakes.⚔️ Strength Is Saying No — Without the SoftenersNo more “Sorry, it’s just that…”No more “I hope that’s okay.”No more padding the truth to make it easier for someone else to swallow.  “He who cannot obey himself will be commanded.”Strength is being able to obey my own voice,to speak with clarity,to let someone else sit with their discomfort instead of rescuing them with mine.🌑 Strength Is Embracing the Chaos — and Not Backing DownI still get cravings. Still feel weight. Still catch myself wanting to soften things.But I see that as part of the process now — not a failure, not weakness.  “One must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.”The mess inside me isn’t something to hide.It’s the fire I’m shaping my life around.And the more I stay with it, the more I uncover something solid underneath.🧍 Strength Is Letting Go of the Fear of ArroganceThere’s still a little voice inside me that says:Don’t be too much. Don’t be too direct. Don’t come across as arrogant.But I know that voice.It’s the voice that kept me pleasing, softening, dimming myself to stay safe.The truth is:Real strength doesn’t need to dominate or prove anything.It just stands.And I’m ready to stand — even if my legs are shaking a little.🔥 Strength Is Becoming — Not Just SurvivingThe old identity is falling away.The one who coped by being “nice.”The one who swallowed anger and smiled through it.The one who craved food to soothe emotions no one helped me hold.  “The snake that cannot shed its skin must perish.”I’m shedding. Slowly. Deliberately.Not because I hate who I was — but because I’m ready to become who I am.💬 Strength, For Me, Looks Like This Now:  Speaking clearly — not cruelly, but firmly.  Holding boundaries — even when I feel shaky inside.  No longer explaining myself to people committed to misunderstanding me.  Trusting that the truth doesn’t need a filter.  Creating something real instead of trying to be liked.  “Do not pity yourself. Marvel at yourself.” — NietzscheI’m still learning. Still wobbling sometimes.But I can feel it: the softness is becoming steel.Not cold. Not cruel. But strong. Rooted. Honest.This is what strength looks like for me now.Maybe it will look like that for you too."

But I don’t think I will be.Not out of arrogance—out of clarity.I know who I am now. I know what I bring.And I know, with just as much steadiness, that I’ve been wrong before.I could be wrong again.But even if I was—if I didn’t make it—I’d be okay.I’d take a year out. Reflect. Ask for feedback. Integrate what I learn.That wouldn’t be failure. It would be a reorientation.The Selection Process Feels… FoggySome are getting online interviews.Some are being invited in.Some haven’t heard a word.It’s disorienting.There doesn’t seem to be a pattern that makes sense from the outside.But I do know this:I was invited in in person—early, in fact. Maybe even the first.Was that because they had a question about me? Maybe.Was it because they needed clarity, to really see me again? Possibly.Was it because they cared enough to want that clarity? Definitely.A Quiet Trust in My PathOne of the tutors who interviewed me knows me well.There’s history there. Depth. Some projection, maybe, but also mutual recognition.I think they see me. Even if there’s uncertainty, I believe there’s also trust.And here’s the other truth:I’ve shown up.I’ve done the work.I’ve reflected with honesty.I’ve missed just one session in an entire year, while others missed several.Yes, I’ve been late a few times—but I’ve been present.In every sense of the word.Given the circumstances of my life right now, I’ve done everything within my power to get here.So if I don’t get through to Level 4, it won’t be because I held back.It won’t be because I didn’t care.It won’t be because I didn’t show up.And that brings me peace.Because sometimes the most honest thing you can say is:I did my best. And I’m proud of it."

      "url": "/blog/vulnerability-and-the-risk-of-being-seen/",
      "date": "June 12, 2025",
      "content": "Something happened yesterday that I’m still unpacking. It wasn’t dramatic — no huge betrayal or outburst — just a string of jokes that hit a little too close to something I’ve held quietly.There was a moment, maybe two or three, where someone joked that I was “basically one of the women anyway,” because I was the only man in the group. At first I tried to laugh it off — making light by saying something like “I’m going to reveal something soon” just to soften the edge. But by the third comment, when someone else joked about “revealing my sex to everyone,” it stopped being funny. I said, “That’s a bit too far. I feel uncomfortable.” And I meant it.What stung the most was that it came from someone I love and trust — someone who, in a way, has felt like a mother figure to me. And maybe that’s why it landed deeper. Not because I think she meant any harm, but because I was so open. So emotionally present. And when I’m in that state, even playful teasing can graze the parts of me still trying to heal.I don’t think it was about the specific words. It was about how vulnerable I’ve been willing to be. How much I’ve opened up. And in that space, there’s always risk — of being misunderstood, laughed at, or judged in subtle ways. It made me wonder: Does my emotional openness make me seem less masculine? Do my reflections, my honesty, make people assume things about me?There’s a shadow that creeps in when those thoughts come. That old whisper — “Maybe you’re too soft. Maybe you’re too much.” But here’s what I came back to:I’m not ashamed of how deeply I feel.I’m not afraid of being called sensitive.And I don’t need to justify my masculinity, my sexuality, or my depth to anyone.What I’m learning is that the real strength is in staying open — even when it’s uncomfortable. Especially when it’s uncomfortable. There’s a quiet power in not retreating, in not armoring up. I could shut down. I could become guarded. But I won’t. That’s not the path I’m on anymore.I also recognize that this isn’t about punishing the people I care about for a few misplaced jokes. It’s about letting myself process the emotional residue that came with them. Because even love can sometimes sting, and it’s okay to say “that hurt” without it meaning “you’re a bad person.”There’s so much that happened in those three hours yesterday. So much content, so much subtle movement. It may take me weeks to let it all settle. And that’s okay too.This is part of being human.Part of being awake.Part of being seen.And I’d rather be seen — even imperfectly — than keep hiding the parts of me that want to live out loud."

      "content": "I’m starting to realise how much of my life I’ve spent wearing a mask — not out of malice or manipulation, but as a way to be liked. To be safe. To be accepted.At college, I notice I still do it.I soften myself for certain people who I get a weird vibe from — over-extending to prove I’m okay. But underneath, I think I know they’ve already made their minds up about me. Maybe I trigger something in them. Maybe I remind them of something they’re not ready to face.And then I catch myself — trying too hard to be light, to be liked.Trying to make myself palatable.It’s familiar.Too familiar.I used to do this all the time at university.People used to say “You’re only real when you’re drunk.”And they were probably right.I drank to feel free.To feel uninhibited.To say and do what I couldn’t in the daylight.But then I tipped too far.I drank too much.Got into fights.Got kicked out of clubs.Played the protector. Played the wildcard. Played the one people talked about the next day.But none of it felt like me.It was just the role I had taken on — because the people around me didn’t know how to love the real me.And maybe I didn’t either.I’d finally escaped my parents. But I didn’t know how to be free.So I recreated the chaos I grew up in.I found people who felt familiar.Assertive, aggressive personalities that made me feel small — just like home.And I played my part again. Quiet. Attuned. Hyper-vigilant.Trying to stay safe in the system I already knew how to survive.It’s only in the last few years I’ve learned to say:  “Nah. Fuck off. Get out of my life.”Not from rage — but from clarity.From finally understanding that I don’t owe anyone my compliance.That I’ve only kept some people around because, unconsciously, they made me feel at home.And home wasn’t safe.It’s been an eight-year process. And I’m still unwinding it.Still catching myself falling into roles that aren’t mine.Still shedding the shame of being “fake” — because I wasn’t fake. I was just surviving.Freud called it the repetition compulsion — reenacting our early dynamics because it feels familiar, even if it’s harmful.And he was right.But what Freud didn’t tell us is that we can stop.We can wake up.We can choose something different.I’m doing that now.Piece by piece.Boundary by boundary.Not perfectly, but with more awareness than ever before.And if this is what real freedom feels like —Then maybe, finally, I’m on my way home."

      "date": "June 12, 2025",
      "content": "One of the things I’ve been sitting with lately is this quiet fear — that my openness, my honesty here, might push people away. Not because I’m attacking them, but because they might see themselves in my writing and feel exposed, or worry they’re being “called out.”And that’s not my intention. That’s never been the point of this blog.The truth is: I don’t use names, and I don’t plan to. But I do write about how things affect me — especially when I don’t feel seen or when something small lands deeper than it was meant to. Because sometimes people don’t notice. They don’t ask. They don’t realize that a joke touched a wound I’ve spent years trying to heal.And it would be too much to point it out every time — to stop the room, explain the entire history behind a subtle facial expression or the way my body tensed. That’s not always appropriate. But writing? Writing is how I understand myself. It’s how I reflect. How I release. How I make room for softness in a world that rarely rewards it.I am a sensitive man.Far more sensitive than most men — maybe more than most women too.And I’ve spent most of my life rejecting that part of myself.I was told it was too much.Too intense.Too feminine.Too… inconvenient.And yet, that same sensitivity is what allows me to comfort others when they’re hurting.It’s what makes people feel safe with me.It’s what allows me to write like this.But it’s also what gets judged when I say, “That hurt.”It’s loved when it soothes, but questioned when it sets a boundary.Still, I’m tired of shaming it.And while I may not be completely free of that shame yet, I am learning to carry it with more grace.To be kinder to the boy in me who was told to toughen up.If anyone ever did have a problem with what I write, I’d welcome a conversation.If they can bring it to me, we can talk.If they can’t, then maybe there isn’t a connection deep enough to worry about losing.I’m not writing this blog to blame or expose anyone.I’m writing because I’m trying to find a place where my sensitivity can live.A place where my love for truth — even the harsh or philosophical kind, the kind Nietzsche explored — can sit beside my softness.A place where thought and feeling aren’t at war.That, to me, is a beautiful kind of strength.Because I believe now — maybe for the first time — that hiding myself is the worst crime I could possibly commit.So I’ll keep writing.Not for validation. Not for vengeance.But because this is how I stay free."

      "date": "June 12, 2025",
      "content": "This morning I woke up craving sugar. I had jam on toast with butter — a lot of it. And part of me knows I probably overdid it calorie-wise, but there’s another part of me that just needed it. Needed comfort. And I think that part — the one that took the wheel — was my inner child.There’s something about mornings when we’re not quite anchored. Sometimes the child in us wakes before the adult does. It wasn’t really about sugar. It was about warmth, safety, sweetness — not in taste, but in feeling. I didn’t shame myself for it. I just noticed it. That’s new.A little later, I found myself thinking about my old therapist — someone I haven’t seen in maybe six months. And the pull was strong. He’s a tutor at college, so maybe part of me is reaching for reassurance in a space that feels uncertain. Again, the wounded child. Searching for something familiar. Safe. Held.And I think all of this is okay.What I’m sitting with today is this question:Should I be trying to meet all these needs myself, or am I still allowed to reach out?Am I clinging to the idea of interdependence — of co-regulation — because I’m scared to fully stand on my own?Or is that just the old narrative talking — the one that says being alone is dangerous, even insane?I don’t know for sure. But I know I’m not actually alone. Not really. I meet people every day — in small moments, short interactions, even here, with you, reading this. There’s a connection in that, even if it’s quiet.I guess part of this blog — this whole project — has become a place where I meet myself. But it’s also something more. A breadcrumb trail. A map.Maybe someday, my family — or someone I used to know — will only be able to understand me through the words I leave behind here. That’s a strange feeling. But not a bad one.I want them to see this:Not perfection. Not answers.Just someone doing the work.Trying to stay honest.Trying to come home to himself.So here I am.Noticing.Letting it move through.And moving on."

Cold baths.Not in a punishing way, but in a clarifying way.Cold wakes something up in me. It grounds me.And it doesn’t drain my battery the way heat does.Running, too—expends energy, yes, but it’s rhythmic. Sustainable.

      "date": "June 12, 2025",
      "content": "We all reach for quick fixes—sugar, scrolling, porn, excess comfort—when something deeper is calling. What if, instead of judging ourselves, we paused to ask:  “What need is really underneath this urge?”Below is a practical menu of healthier alternatives, sorted by the needs they meet and adaptable to whatever energy you have in the moment.🔍 1. Comfort &amp; GroundingWhen you feel overwhelmed or scattered, these practices can substitute that numbing sugar rush:  Wrap up in a blanket and stream a comfort movie or show.  Run warm water over your hands for 60 seconds, breathing slowly.  Try a guided body-scan meditation—lying down and talking yourself through each part.  Hug a pillow, close your eyes, and let your muscles soften.These are gentle hugs from the inside, without the sugar.💛 2. Affection &amp; ConnectionWhen loneliness or disconnection strikes, swap pornography or binge-eating for:  Send a quick text or voice note to someone you trust.  Sit with your pet; stroke them and speak kindly.  Write an unsent letter to your younger self—offer the words you needed.  Play a song that stirs you, and let the melody meet the ache.Sometimes simply allowing the longing to be felt brings relief.🧠 3. Stimulation &amp; AlivenessWhen you’re bored or emotionally flat, trade a hit of dopamine for:  Take a brisk 5-minute walk to raise your heart rate.  Splash cold water on your face or step into a quick cold shower.  Solve a brain teaser or play a short online game.  Watch an inspiring clip—spoken word, music, or travel highlights.These spark your system without hijacking it.🌿 4. Rest &amp; IntegrationWhen you’re drained or tense, resist the pull of comfort food and instead:  Lie down, close your eyes, and be still for 10 minutes.  Take a short nap—surrender to the pause.  Journal a few lines: “What feels heavy right now?”  Whisper to yourself: “It’s okay to do nothing.”True rest isn’t sloth—it’s medicine.✨ 5. Emotional ExpressionWhen big feelings need release, rather than bottling them up:  Speak your truth out loud—even if it’s only to yourself in the mirror.  Record a raw voice memo; you don’t have to playback if you don’t want to.  Write a “What I wish someone would say to me” note and read it aloud.  Allow yourself to cry; every tear completes a cycle.Expression completes emotional loops. Suppression fuels the next craving.🧰 Crafting Your “In-The-Moment” Flow  Pause for 10 seconds when the urge arises.  Ask: What’s the real need beneath this?  Choose one action from the list that fits your energy right now.And if you still reach for the cake or the scroll afterward—do it kindly. You paused. You reflected. That awareness alone is progress.🌄 Building New RoadsYou’re not battling “bad” habits—you’re rediscovering how to meet your own needs. The old urges will come—especially when you’re tired or raw—but now you have healthier pathways. With practice, they become the default, guiding you back to pride instead of depletion.(Adapted from personal reflections on coping, addiction, and self-care.)"

      "date": "June 12, 2025",
      "content": "I’ve been reflecting on my son’s current obsession with collecting football cards. He’s spending all his money on them — money mostly given to him by his grandparents — and while part of me feels uneasy about it, another part of me sees it as a pretty normal part of childhood.There’s something in the way he lights up when opening a new pack, that hit of excitement and anticipation. Sure, it’s a dopamine hit — but isn’t that what so many hobbies start from? He’s proud of what he’s built up, and even if the cards aren’t overly expensive, it’s not really about the money. It’s about ownership, pride, and choosing something for himself. That in itself feels like a lesson worth learning.I’ve had some boundaries around it, though. I don’t allow him to take the collection to school. He was really annoyed about that — understandably — but I saw how devastated he was once when someone ripped one of his cards. If he lost the whole file, it would be a major emotional collapse, and the truth is, I might not have the space to support him through something so easily avoidable.I explained to him: “You can’t bring it to school, but you’re welcome to show Riley if you want.” Riley’s the mate across the road. He did show him, even though Riley wasn’t especially interested. But he got what he needed — the ability to share and be seen. That mattered.It’s moments like this that show me we’re doing an okay job. He’s learning. He’s experiencing pride. He’s choosing how to spend his money. And I’m learning, too — to not overreact, to set boundaries with care, and to recognize that sometimes, good parenting is about letting things unfold, trusting that the little decisions matter.I don’t think anyone’s parenting journey is perfect. But I feel good about this one."

      "content": "There’s a strange energy in the air when you finally walk away from the people who conditioned you — especially when those people were your family.In the silence that follows, there’s space.And in that space, I find myself reaching for voices that don’t sugarcoat the pain, but also don’t flinch from the power it holds.One of those voices for me has been Friedrich Nietzsche.If I were to take his ideas and infuse them into my life right now — in this raw, in-between, rebuilding place — these are the ones that resonate.Maybe they’ll resonate for you too.🗿 1. Become Who You AreThis one hits different when you’ve been shaped by narcissistic conditioning.I spent years trying to be good. Accommodating. Acceptable.Now?I want to be real.  “Become who you are! Do what only you can do. Be the master and the sculptor of yourself.”It’s a daily invitation to peel back the layers that were never really me — and to stop apologizing for the fire that’s been buried underneath.🌑 2. Let Chaos Be SacredSometimes I still feel overwhelmed — the weight, the exhaustion, the cravings, the grief.But Nietzsche reframes that chaos as necessary. Not as a flaw, but as fuel.  “One must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.”I’m learning not to rush past the mess.To sit in it. To breathe in it.Because maybe this isn’t a breakdown — maybe it’s a birth.🧍‍♂️ 3. Obey Yourself NowI’m no longer under my mother’s rule, or anyone else’s script.But that also means I need to learn to follow something deeper — my own soul.  “He who cannot obey himself will be commanded.”That looks like eating what truly nourishes me. Saying no.Honouring when I’m exhausted instead of overriding myself.  “No price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.”And I’m paying that price. Willingly.⚔️ 4. Live DangerouslyNot in a reckless way — but in a way that lets me lean into life.Speak my truth. Create something that matters.Even if it’s quiet. Even if no one sees it but me.  “The secret of reaping the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment from life is to live dangerously!”For me, that might be filming a video in Norway.Or writing honestly.Or showing up to the day with nothing to prove.🐍 5. Shed or DieThere’s an old identity falling away:The boy who tolerated too much.The man who kept the peace to stay connected.The version of me who coped by overeating and staying small.  “The snake that cannot shed its skin must perish.”I’m shedding. It’s painful. But it’s working.Something new is being revealed.🧠 A Few Truths I’m Carrying Forward  You don’t need to be understood by the people you left behind.  You are allowed to choose silence over performance.  Solitude can be fertile ground.  You’re not meant to stay a caterpillar out of guilt that the others won’t fly.  “Do not pity yourself. Marvel at yourself.”I’m trying.This healing isn’t linear.But it is real.And if you’re here too — rebuilding, unraveling, reclaiming — then maybe you’re not falling apart.Maybe you’re just becoming.And Nietzsche, in all his raw, unfiltered brilliance, might have smiled at that."

Fried. Like every part of me had been used up.And I kept wondering why — what had really happened underneath the surface?Then it landed.My social battery didn’t just run out — it protected me.I was in two difficult emotional situations:One person was likely feeling a lot of shame, and maybe unconsciously wanted me to soften, to soothe, to step out of my truth and comfort them. But I didn’t. I held strong. I stayed grounded in what I knew to be true for me — even if that made them uncomfortable.Another person repeatedly mocked me — calling me a woman, over and over, until it became deeply uncomfortable. It wasn’t banter anymore. It felt violating. And in the end, I left.That’s the real reason I was fried.Because I didn’t abandon myself.I didn’t betray my own body’s signals. I didn’t contort into someone else’s emotional needs.I stood in who I was, even when it cost me comfort, connection, or approval.And that’s new.That’s huge.In the past, my nervous system would’ve shut all this down. I would’ve dissociated, minimized it, told myself I was being too sensitive. I might have even shamed myself for walking away.But not anymore.I’m starting to notice that when I wake up rested, the truth becomes more digestible.I can meet it.I can process it.I can hold it without falling apart.And that’s what adulthood is starting to mean for me:Not perfection. Not endless emotional stamina.But the capacity to hold truths that used to break me.I don’t need to control what happens anymore. I just need to stay open to the lessons.Because yes — the more I reveal myself, the more exposed I become.It feels more dangerous.But it’s through that exposure — through that edge — that I truly meet myself.Anyone can say, “I believe in authenticity.”But then life asks: “Do you really?”People test it. Consciously or not.They poke. They prod. They push.And yesterday, I didn’t collapse.I passed the test. With flying colours.Not only did I leave when people were being disrespectful — or when it felt disrespectful to me —I also left with class. With courage. With presence.I hugged everyone. I didn’t make a scene.I just walked out, put my sunglasses on, and went home.And there’s a deep pride in that.A quiet kind of strength that comes from holding myself when no one else could.I’m so insanely proud of how I honoured myself.This wasn’t avoidance.This was alignment.And that matters more to me than being liked, understood, or validated in the moment.Because this is who I am now:Someone who walks away with grace — not guilt."

      "content": "There’s something strange — almost surreal — about seeing parts of yourself in the man your ex left you for.It’s not about jealousy.It’s not even about betrayal anymore.It’s about recognition.The more I hear about him, the more I realise:He could have been me.The mother-son dynamic is similar. The infantilisation. The quiet undercurrent of emotional enmeshment that never quite lets a person grow up. He still loves Lego at 43, doesn’t hold down a job that pays more than minimum wage, and moves through the world like someone quietly waiting for permission to live.And I get it.I know that place.That’s the version of me I might have become — if I hadn’t gone to therapy. If I hadn’t done the hard work of breaking those inner ties and finally taking responsibility for my own emotional growth.He listens to the same kind of music I once clung to — back when I needed it just to survive. Music that held my pain when I didn’t have the words yet. There’s a strange familiarity there, and part of me even wonders if we could’ve connected in some other timeline. Maybe we could’ve talked about what it’s like to grow up emotionally stunted. Maybe we would’ve understood each other’s wounds.But that’s not how I connect anymore.I don’t build relationships through shared damage.I connect through awareness. Through growth. Through the long, messy process of becoming who I actually am — not just who I had to be to survive.And then there’s her — the mother of my child.The one who cheated, then circled back.The one who tried to make it work again, and for a while, maybe I believed she meant it. But even now, I’m not sure why. Was it manipulation? Was it a play to get married and gain access to my money? Was it something even more calculated?Maybe he told me the truth because he felt guilty.Or maybe — more likely — it wasn’t about protecting me at all.Maybe he just didn’t want to share her anymore.Maybe it was his way of staking a claim, regardless of the fallout.And the truth is: I don’t need to know.I don’t need to romanticise his motives, or hers.I don’t need closure in a box tied with string.Because I see what I needed to see:That could have been me.But it’s not.I walked away.I did the work.I chose self-respect, even when it meant being alone.Even when it hurt.Even when no one clapped for it.And that, finally, is peace.Not a loud, triumphant peace.A quiet one. The kind that settles in your bones after years of chaos.The kind that doesn’t need revenge or understanding — just release.I don’t need answers anymore.I don’t need explanations.I have what matters: the knowing that I’ve changed.They’re still living inside the story I walked out of.And that story no longer belongs to me.Mine is being written elsewhere —With more truth.More fire.And far more love — the kind that doesn’t tear me apart."

      "content": "In a group of nearly twenty people, it’s fascinating — and humbling — to realise that only a handful have felt truly safe.Yesterday offered me a lot. It challenged me, triggered me, and ultimately clarified something I didn’t even know I needed to see: who actually holds space for me — and who can’t.There are three women in particular who come to mind.One of them has a son a little younger than me, and there’s something about the way she carries herself that puts me at ease. She’s grounded, perceptive, and has this soft, steady kind of energy. I think she sees my sensitivity — not as a flaw, but as something deeply human. Maybe she’s had to hide her own softness at times, and sees the difficulty in me wearing mine openly. There’s a quiet understanding there that doesn’t need to be spoken.Another woman’s warmth caught me completely off guard the first few times we spoke. Her kindness isn’t performative — it’s safe. There’s no need to shrink or perform around her. She just… is. And in her presence, I feel like I can just be too.And then there’s the one who held space for me when I shared about my psychosis and hospitalisation — two things that carry deep shame for me. What she said still echoes inside me:  “What I see here, Alex, is someone who has shown courage in the face of adversity and has overcome things that many people would crumble with.”That’s one of the most beautiful things anyone has ever said to me. And she meant it.These three women — each in their own way — have created emotional safety in a space where that’s supposed to be the norm, but often isn’t. There are others in the group who seem far too busy, scattered, or emotionally unavailable to meet anyone on a real level. Their energy is sharp. They joke when something vulnerable is shared. They expect to be soothed, even when they’re the ones causing harm. They haven’t slowed down enough to look inward.And it’s not a judgment. Just a reflection.I’m realising now that how busy someone is — emotionally, mentally, logistically — often correlates with how much space they can hold for me. Not just practically, but spiritually. If someone is running at full speed all the time, there’s rarely any room left for depth. And that’s okay. But it does mean I now know: those aren’t my people for the long haul.It’s a quiet grief — the realisation that even in spaces designed for emotional growth, not everyone is capable of going there.But it’s also a beautiful kind of clarity.Because life seems to be slowly guiding me to the few who can.Who listen.Who don’t flinch.Who reflect back something I thought might always be too much.These are hard-won lessons — learned through quiet rejection and sacred redirection.And even though I wish I were more universally understood, I’m learning something even better:It’s okay if only a few people can hold me.Because those few are everything."

Even when it was slow.Even when it was lonely.Even when you weren’t sure if you were healing or just surviving.And that’s why you’re here now, living the life your younger self only dreamed might be possible.Keep going. You’re closer than you think.I still feel the tug sometimes — the guilt, the wish that it could have been different.But I’m not bargaining for love anymore. I’m not feeding myself crumbs and calling it connection.I’m here. I’m alive. And I’m learning how to give myself what I was never given.The weight will start to fall away — not because I hate my body, but because I’m not carrying their pain anymore.Bit by bit, I’m letting go.Not because I’m healed — but because I’m healing.That’s enough.

It said “I love you” — from someone else.She told me nothing had happened. No intimacy. No crossing of physical lines.And I believed her.I let two weeks pass. We talked. We decided to try again. I wanted to believe. I wanted to hold the family together. I wanted it to be true.But it wasn’t.Later, I found out it was all a lie. The intimacy had already happened.And the most jarring part?She lied to my face.In front of my family.For months — maybe years.I’ll never know the full truth. I’ve stopped trying to.But when I did find out, I left.I didn’t scream.I didn’t smash things.I didn’t punish her.I just asked her to leave.She said, “How can you kick me out?”I said, “You cheated on me. What did you expect?”And that was that.She tried to kiss me in that moment — some kind of strange attempt at soothing, or seduction, or damage control. I don’t know. But I do remember how it made me feel: numb.Like the relationship itself had collapsed inward, and there was no coming back.What’s hardest now isn’t the betrayal.It’s the lingering question: Was any of it real?Did she ever love me?Or was I projecting love onto someone who couldn’t meet me there?Maybe I wasn’t being fully seen.Maybe I wasn’t even showing all of myself — I was still hiding my emotional depth then, trying to fit into something more palatable. More expected.It lasted six years.We had a child together.And yet… I’m not sure if there was ever true emotional intimacy.That’s a hard truth to sit with.Not because I want it back — I don’t.But because I want to understand it.So I don’t repeat it.So I don’t pass on distorted love to my son through the examples I set.I’m not writing this to demonise her.I’m writing this because there’s still grief there.A grief that doesn’t need to scream anymore — it just wants to be heard.The grief of having loved where love wasn’t fully possible.The grief of not being seen while trying so hard to be good.The grief of trying to make something whole that was quietly breaking the whole time.And also — the quiet pride.Because when the truth came out, I didn’t become someone I’d regret.I stayed grounded.I protected both of us.I made a choice — not for revenge, but for clarity.Because I knew if I didn’t walk away, I’d lose myself.And I’m proud of the man who made that choice.For my son.For myself.And for the life I’m still becoming."

A quiet signal from my nervous system that it finally feels safe enough to recharge. For weeks, I’ve been pouring myself into emotional work, processing old pain, parenting full-time, holding boundaries, rebuilding my sense of self. And while I’ve made progress, I’ve also been drained.Reaching 100% feels surreal. I’m not used to this kind of surplus. There’s a temptation to sprint, to “make the most” of it. But I know better now. This kind of energy isn’t something to cash in on. It’s something to honour.I still want to be careful with it. Gently curious. Like I’m meeting a part of myself that’s been gone for a while — not pushing, just saying: “Welcome back. You can rest now. You don’t need to fight so hard anymore.”If this is what my new normal looks like — if this is what’s becoming possible — then I feel genuinely excited about life. I can begin doing things as I please, not out of pressure or urgency, but from a place of choice. There’s a freedom here. A lightness. A new rhythm that I didn’t have access to before.And the most important part?I didn’t force this.I created the conditions for it — by listening, slowing down, protecting my peace, and offering myself the love I needed.This isn’t just a recovery. It’s a quiet becoming."

      "content": "Today, I received a small token of appreciation from someone I volunteer with. Just a little gesture — some sweets and the kind of tea I like. But it hit me harder than I expected.I nearly cried.And with that almost-crying came a wave of shame. Not because of the gift — but because of how much it meant to me. Because it quietly highlighted something I’ve spent most of my life avoiding: how rare it’s been to feel seen in this way. How starved I’ve been of this kind of care. How I used to brush off small acts of kindness because I didn’t know how to receive them. I wasn’t in a place that felt safe enough to let them in.But today, I did.And it meant everything.It’s strange how something so small — a cup of tea, remembered from months ago — can soften a person in a way that years of effort can’t. Because it wasn’t about the tea. It was about being noticed. Held in someone else’s mind. Offered something without needing to prove I deserved it.That’s what undid me.There’s a grief in it too. A quiet mourning for all the times I didn’t get that. For all the versions of me that had to carry on without it. And maybe even for the times I was offered care, but wasn’t able to trust it enough to let it land.But if there’s one thing I’m learning — it’s that being able to receive care is its own kind of milestone. It’s a sign that I’m softening. That I’m safe enough now to let kindness touch me, even if it still stings on the way in.So this blog post is my thank-you. Not just to the person who gave the gift — but to the part of me that finally felt worthy enough to receive it.That’s the real gift today."

And I want you to know from the start: you were never the problem.In fact, you were — and still are — the most beautiful part of something that was otherwise very painful.When you were born, I was under a huge amount of emotional pressure. Your mum and I had problems that I couldn’t fully understand at the time. I was overwhelmed, and I went through something called psychosis — a moment where my mind just couldn’t cope anymore. It felt like everything I believed about life and love was breaking down. But that wasn’t because of you. That was because of years of unresolved pain and pressure that finally broke through.You were not the cause.You were the anchor.There are parts of the story I’ll tell you in more detail when you’re ready — not because I want you to take sides, but because I believe in honesty. I don’t want to hand you a fantasy version of life. I want you to grow up knowing that you can handle truth — and that even painful truths don’t have to define us.The hardest part is this: I think I may have stayed in the relationship longer than I should have — partly because I was scared of breaking up the home we were building. I wanted you to grow up in something stable. I thought I was doing the right thing. But over time, I realised that staying in something unhealthy doesn’t serve anyone — not even the child we think we’re staying for.So I left.And I left with love in my heart — for myself, for the kind of man I wanted to become, and for you. Because I don’t want you to grow up thinking that love means staying somewhere that’s hurting you. I want you to see that real love includes honesty, integrity, and self-respect.One day, you might feel confused about what happened between your mum and me. You might have questions I can’t fully answer.But always come back to this:  You were not a mistake. You were a miracle.And everything I’ve done since then has been to become the kind of father who can show you what real, grounded love looks like.I love you more than I’ll ever be able to say.And I’m proud of the life we’re building — even if it began in pain.— Dad"

      "content": "“You should be better by now.”That voice.Cold. Precise. Condescending.It rises up every time I stumble into an old pattern. Every time I follow the familiar pull toward someone who can’t give me what I need.It doesn’t ask what I’m feeling. It doesn’t offer support.It just stands there with a clipboard and a scowl, like an inspector evaluating my progress.  “You’ve had seven or eight years of therapy.”“You’re training to be a counsellor.”“You’ve done all this work — and still?”Still.Still I reach. Still I ache. Still I act a little lost sometimes.And that voice — the one I now recognize as my mother’s voice, internalized and sharpened — calls it failure.But it’s not failure.It’s human.It’s the shape of old wounds healing in slow, spiraling layers — not neat, not linear.That voice says I’m boring.That I should be past this.That feeling shame for acting out an old pattern is somehow shameful in itself.And I’m tired of believing it.Because I’ve learned that healing isn’t about never feeling pain again.It’s about what I do with the pain now.  Now, I notice it.  Now, I name the pull.  Now, I don’t spiral into self-hatred. I pause. I breathe. I write. I stay.That’s progress.That’s everything.The critical voice wants perfection.But I want truth.And the truth is:  I’m still healing.I’m still growing.I’m still learning to love myself without conditions.I’m still learning to offer warmth where there used to be judgement.I may hear that old voice again.It may say: “You should be better by now.”But now I have a quieter voice of my own, rising up in response:  “You’re doing beautifully. This is what healing looks like. Keep going.”"

Too caught up in their own storms to ever truly notice mine.And it’s frustrating.Because I know the pattern. I see it happening. And yet some part of me still lights up around them.It’s not rational. It’s not even about them.It’s about what they represent.They feel familiar. Not safe — but known.Something in my nervous system says:  “Here’s your chance. If you can just be good enough, calm enough, interesting enough, maybe this time you’ll be chosen. Maybe this time it’ll go differently.”But it never does.Because they’re not actually available.Because I’m not being seen — I’m being activated.And the worst part? I feel like I lose myself trying to be seen.I want to show them I’m worth knowing. I reach. I over-function. I hope.And somewhere along the way, I stop listening to the part of me that’s quietly whispering:  “You’re already worth knowing. You just keep chasing people who don’t have the capacity to show you that.”It’s exhausting. And sad.Because I think I’ve been doing it for years.And people probably saw it — the way I’d quietly pursue someone who wasn’t really present.They saw me disappear into those old dynamics.And I think part of me knew, too.I don’t hate these people. They’re not bad. They’re just not able to meet me.And it’s not my job to pull presence out of people who aren’t offering it.What I’m learning — slowly — is that recognizing the pattern is the first step.Not trying to kill the feeling.Not blaming myself for wanting.Just seeing it clearly and not following it this time.Because when the wrong people feel like home, it’s not about staying away from them.It’s about building a new home inside myself.One where love isn’t something I have to earn.Where I don’t have to chase, explain, or prove anything.Where I can feel safe, even when someone else doesn’t see me.And I’m starting to do that.Little by little, I’m learning how to stay with myself — even when I feel the pull.Especially then."

Not really.Because I shared my truth. I spoke gently, but honestly, about my beliefs — beliefs shaped by a childhood where emotional expression wasn’t welcome.And I think something I said struck a nerve in her.Not because I was harsh — but because she saw herself in my story, and maybe that was uncomfortable.After that, she seemed to withdraw. Shut down. I felt it.And I kept replaying it in my head — wondering if I’d said too much, been too much.But here’s what I’m realizing:I didn’t perform. I didn’t abandon myself.I showed up authentically. And still, it didn’t feel good afterward.And that’s the part that hurts — because sometimes I imagine that being true to myself will always feel peaceful.But it doesn’t always.Sometimes it brings discomfort. Sometimes people pull away.Sometimes I’m left feeling like I did something wrong, even when I didn’t.Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle:  She was probably doing her best to navigate her own shame.  I was probably unconsciously hoping for validation.  And my body was tracking all of it — the tension, the effort, the unspoken emotional labor — before I even knew what was happening.That’s why I crashed.Not because I failed, but because I was holding a lot, all at once.And now I see it more clearly.Sometimes you can show up in your integrity, speak from the heart, and still leave an interaction feeling exhausted or misunderstood.That doesn’t mean you were wrong to be yourself.It just means that honesty, when it lands in someone’s sore spot, isn’t always received as connection.Still, I’m proud of how I handled it.No blame. No shaming. Just truth.And if that was too much for her in that moment — that’s okay.I’m learning to trust that being too much for the wrong person doesn’t mean I’m too much at all.It means I’m healing.And I’m here."

I just acted from a place that’s still healing.And the truth is, people who really see me won’t lose respect for me over a moment like this.And if they do?Maybe they were never safe to begin with.Still, I feel sad.Sad that I wasn’t more anchored.Sad that I hoped again.Sad that I’m still a little wounded, still a little young inside, still looking for something that didn’t arrive.But I’m here.And I’m not running from the feeling this time.That’s how it changes.Not by pretending it didn’t happen.But by staying with it.

I still move my body with ease. There’s just… a softness to me now. A physical underbelly that mirrors, in many ways, the emotional softness I’ve had to grow into.And I can’t pretend this weight just appeared without reason. I know why it’s here.I needed comfort.I needed something to hold me when life felt heavy, and lonely, and unspoken.And food—predictable, soothing, easy—stepped in where no one else did.It worked.Not perfectly. But it worked.And now I’m here. With a body that tells a story not just of meals eaten, but of a nervous system that was trying to regulate. Of nights I spent trying to feel safe. Of moments when isolation made me reach for something warm, something that never judged me.So is it my fault?Is it the food’s fault?Or is it the fault of being born into a world that never really accepted me the way I needed it to?I don’t know.But what I do know is this:This isn’t weakness.This isn’t laziness.This is survival.This weight is part of how I got through.And now, things are shifting. I’m eating healthier food. I’m cooking with care. I’m enjoying being active again. The emotional pull toward food has softened—not because I’m punishing myself, but because I’m finally learning to soothe myself in other ways.There’s still shame, sure. But there’s also compassion.A voice that says, “You did what you needed to do. And now, we can choose something new.”I don’t need to erase this version of myself to move forward.I just need to love him enough to keep going.And maybe—just maybe—this softness is something I can carry with tenderness, not shame.Because this is the weight of survival.

      "content": "Sometimes emotional unavailability is obvious — cold, dismissive, distant.But other times, it’s subtle.It hides in polite smiles, scattered attention, or someone being just emotionally present enough to keep you engaged, but not enough to truly meet you.And that’s where things get confusing.Because today, I don’t think I was with someone completely shut down.She wasn’t cruel or detached. She wasn’t trying to hurt me.But she wasn’t really there either — not in the way I needed.And I felt it… somewhere.Not in a thought. Not even in a feeling.But in my body — in the fatigue that came afterward, in the slow sense of collapse.It wasn’t until much later that I wondered:  “Was she just not emotionally available enough for me?”And maybe that’s the truth.Maybe I didn’t walk away questioning my worth, but my body did the math.It picked up on the lack of resonance, the tiny disconnections, the quiet absence behind her eyes.And it said: “This isn’t it.”Not with drama.Just with stillness.With exhaustion.And I think that’s the hardest kind of disconnection to name — when someone isn’t toxic, but they’re not able to offer the depth or presence you long for.It’s not abuse. It’s almost.Almost seen. Almost met. Almost safe.But my body knows the difference.It always has.And that’s what I’m learning to trust now — not just my thoughts, not even my heart — but the quiet messages in my nervous system.Because after being around someone who’s truly available, I don’t collapse.I don’t second-guess myself.I don’t feel invisible.I feel more like myself. Not less.So maybe emotional availability isn’t a checklist.Maybe it’s a felt sense.A quiet knowing.A warmth that stays, even after the conversation ends.And the more I listen to my body, the clearer that knowing becomes."

Like something inside me got crisped from the inside out.I’m not sure if this is what it means to be introverted, or if my nervous system just isn’t used to that much openness yet. I don’t think I regret staying — not really. But I can see now that I was done before I actually left. I just didn’t listen soon enough.Maybe this is how I learn my limits. Not by getting it perfect. But by testing them, gently, and noticing what happens after.Right now, I can’t play poker. I can’t run. I can’t even take a bath — my ear still hurts from the last one. All I can really do is lie in bed and let myself be horizontal.And maybe that’s okay.Maybe recovery doesn’t have to be productive. Maybe I don’t have to turn this into a lesson right away. Maybe I just let myself rest.I connected. I shared. I showed up.Now it’s time to let my system come back down.Rest is not a reward for surviving people — it’s a right."

      "content": "I went to the event with everyone, and to be honest, it was lovely. Speaking to so many different people felt nice — even relaxing. There was a sense of acceptance in the air. A gentleness. It felt good to get to know people more deeply.And yet, when I looked at my watch, my stress levels were almost at 100 for the entire time.That was a little sad to see, because in my body, I didn’t feel stressed. I felt very much myself. It all felt natural. But it left me wondering — is this really about being introverted? Or is my nervous system just burnt out?Maybe it’s not about a lack of desire for connection. Maybe it’s just that my system has a limit, and when I hit it — even with safe people — the cost is invisible until later.It’s revealing.There’s also a bittersweetness to it all. Some of the people I connected with today, I may never see again. And the comfort I found in those conversations might not ever happen again either. There’s beauty in that. And grief.A few are planning to go on to Level 4, so maybe I will see them again. Maybe some of those connections will be allowed to deepen. That thought brings some hope.I stayed for three hours — which, for me, in that kind of environment, is a long time. And I managed it. I even enjoyed it. I don’t think I said anything I regret. I felt honest, authentic, and deeply connected in the conversations I had.Some people I didn’t get to talk to as much as I would’ve liked — but that’s okay. Not everything needs to be complete.And something else happened, too.People told me they’d read my blog.They said it had rhythm. That it read like poetry. And that was exactly what I’d hoped for — something that felt like art, not just reflection. One person asked how I learned to write like that, and if I’m honest, I got a lot of help from AI. But AI only helped shape what was already in me. It gave it a texture I didn’t quite know how to express. Now that I’ve heard how it landed, maybe I can carry that rhythm forward on my own, too.It meant a lot — hearing that people spent their own time, their own free time, reading what I wrote. More people than I expected. Maybe even more than I was comfortable with. But there was something healing about it. Something accepting.It was also the first time I spoke out loud to someone about separating from my mother. And these two people I told — they were both mothers themselves. Maybe they didn’t fully understand. But they accepted it, because they already knew who I was. They knew that if I made a decision like that, it would be one I’d sat with deeply. One that came from necessity.Still, there was guilt. There always is, in a way.But it also reminded me — maybe I know myself more than I realize. Maybe I know the theory behind all this, more than most people do. And maybe that means I see things others don’t, and feel things others might not. I don’t know exactly what that means yet.But it means something.Poem:The Cost of LightI lit a candle in a crowded roomand stayed to watch it burn.The flame was gentle, warm —but still, my skin remembered fire.I said things I don’t usually say,and nobody flinched.Some people listened.Some people read.And I was seenin a way that didn’t ask meto shrink."

Then I sat outside in the sun for an hour, listening to music. Not because I should. Not because I was chasing anything. Just because it felt right.And what I noticed was this quiet kind of peace. Not the type that hits like a wave and pulls you under—this was different. It felt earned. Integrated. Like it had been there all along, waiting for me to slow down and meet it.I used to worry that peace like this was dangerous. That it might mean I was about to swing the other way. That if I let myself trust it, I might be setting myself up to fall. I’ve felt that before—the manic high disguised as serenity. It’s a tricky thing.But this isn’t that. This isn’t floating above myself. It’s being in myself. With my feet on the floor. With my music playing. With my body feeling like a home.And even the small choices—like wearing a shirt that feels more me, even if I haven’t had the confidence to wear it out before—add up to something meaningful. That shirt, that hour in the sun, that unhurried movement through the day… they’re not big declarations. They’re soft affirmations. Gentle reminders that I don’t need to earn peace by proving anything.Because peace, I’m learning, isn’t a prize.It’s a birthright.And I’m finally starting to claim it."

And I didn’t see it coming until I was already past it.I’d hoped that maybe, with the right people — people I feel safe with — I could stretch a little further. I’d managed whole days of college before without needing to isolate. I thought maybe I was ready for three hours of straight socializing.And in a way, I was. I showed up. I connected. I genuinely enjoyed it. The level of honesty, the openness — it filled my cup.But only so much of it fits in that cup before it starts overflowing into exhaustion. And today, it overflowed.I came home, laid down, and just… stopped. Two hours disappeared. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t think. It was like a full-system shutdown — and not because anything went wrong, but because I’d gone beyond what was right for me.I’m grieving something, I think. The idea that I could be more social, more easygoing, more unfazed by connection. But what I’m finding is that one deep conversation a day? That’s more than enough. That fills me. And I’d rather pour my energy into someone who can meet me there — not just people whose faces I find myself holding up.I also noticed something about how I speak lately. When someone asks me a question, I answer more fully now. That’s new. Before, I’d offer a word or two and deflect. Now I give detail — but I still jump to asking about them straight after. Maybe I still don’t believe I’m worth sitting with. But I am getting better. This is progress, not perfection.Today taught me something. Maybe two hours is my social sweet spot. Not three. Not a full afternoon. Just enough to connect deeply, and then gently come home to myself.That’s not weakness. That’s wisdom.And next time, I’ll remember:Pace is kindness.One deep conversation a day is a life well lived."

Not just coldness.But the fact that I was never actually loved.Not for who I am. Not ever.I was used.As a pawn.In a quiet, manipulative game of power, shame, and self-avoidance — her own avoidance.And sometimes, even now, that truth slips from awareness.I start taking out my old behavior on myself again.I feel guilt when I’ve done nothing wrong.I question my intuition, my choices, my boundaries — because she trained me not to trust myself.But I’m not making excuses for it anymore.It’s clear as day now:  The more distance I have, the happier I am.The less psychological noise there is.The more me I feel.I know how susceptible my subconscious mind is when I’m near that kind of dynamic — because my nervous system was raised in it. Trained by it.And yeah, there’s grief in that.Grief that I have zero family left in any real sense.But I’d rather have no family than live trapped in a system that keeps me doubting my worth.You can keep your crumbs.Bin them.I’m not starving anymore.I know this voice sounds defiant — even angry.But underneath it is deep, ancient grief:I’ve never truly had a family.Not one person in my family system who ever loved me in a healthy way.That’s a heartbreaking sentence to write.But it’s the truth. And telling the truth is part of reclaiming myself.No wonder I’ve found comfort in food.In other things, too.I’m probably 10–15kg overweight.Still fit, still strong, still flexible — but carrying something heavier than just physical weight.  This is the emotional weight of not being loved for who I am.I’ve carried it alone my whole life.And I won’t shame myself for the ways I’ve survived.Seeking comfort in ways that aren’t perfect but aren’t destructive — that’s not a failure. That’s self-rescue.And yeah, I’m sure my mother’s talking behind my back. That’s nothing new.Maybe she has people reporting back to her — I don’t know.But this time, I’m not in it. I’m not directly affected.No one from my old life is in my new one.I’ve made sure of that. I’ve given myself that permission.Earlier today, I was hard on myself for being drawn toward emotional unavailability again.But even that — I can hold with compassion now.Yes, I was drawn toward something familiar.But I didn’t collapse into it.I didn’t become someone I’m not.I didn’t beg for crumbs.I held my truth.And maybe I still felt like a lost boy at moments.Maybe I still wanted to make someone feel better just so I could feel accepted.That part of me isn’t gone — but I can catch it earlier now.And that’s what matters.This isn’t the end of the pattern.But it is the start of refusing to be ashamed of it.This is what healing looks like:Grief. Truth. Boundaries. Reclamation.No more crumbs."

And while I wish no one harm, I can’t say I’m sad that some of the more difficult dynamics won’t be in the room.Honestly, I feel peaceful. There’s no fear in me today. Just a quiet kind of anticipation. The women in this group… they’re kind, soft, emotionally present in ways that I rarely get to experience. And I care about them. Deeply. More than I expected to. If they don’t move forward onto Level 4, it will feel like a real loss. These might be some of the deepest connections I’ve ever had in my life. But I’ve made peace with the fact that this season is about grieving and embracing. Letting go of what was, and opening to what’s to come.This morning I wore my floral shirt for the first time out in public. I still feel a little insecure in it, but it’s the most comfortable thing I own, and it feels like me. I imagine someone—maybe one of the women—will compliment it, and I’ll breathe a little easier. I might even wear it every day for the rest of my life.There’s a part of me—soft, kind, expressive—that I’ve had to hide for a long time. I had to keep him tucked away to survive in the environments I grew up in. But now… I’m letting him walk beside me. Sometimes even in front of me. And I just guide him gently, kindly, like someone who’s finally learned to be on his own side.That’s what this whole journey feels like now.It’s not about becoming someone new—it’s about letting him be seen.Letting him feel safe enough to lead.Letting him speak with my voice.Letting him live in this world with soft eyes and an open heart.He’s not alone anymore.He has me."

      "date": "June 11, 2025",
      "content": "There’s something I’ve been noticing lately.Even when I’m in a room full of people I know — people I feel relatively safe with — I come away completely worn out. Drained in a way that’s hard to explain. Like I’ve been holding something invisible the whole time.And I think I’ve started to understand what that might be.I think… it’s my inner child.Not necessarily the wounded one — though he’s not far behind — but the present one. The tender, sensitive, always-aware part of me who never really left the room. He’s still there, still scanning for danger, still hoping to be liked, still unsure if he really belongs.Maybe that’s why social spaces feel so intense. Because I’m not just showing up as an adult — I’m bringing my younger self with me. And I’m doing my best to carry him through safely.That’s a lot to hold. No wonder I collapse when I get home.So rather than trying to fix this sensitivity, I’m learning how to support it. To build an internal structure that can actually carry my inner child with kindness, so it doesn’t always feel like survival.Here’s how I’m learning to do that:🧱 1. Recognize when he’s thereIf I feel small, overly eager to please, or hyper-aware of others’ reactions — that’s probably him.He wants to know he’s safe. He wants to know someone’s looking out for him.Now, instead of ignoring that part, I try to pause and say internally:  “Hey buddy, I see you. I’m here.”That’s the start of everything.🗣️ 2. Talk to him gentlyBefore I go into a social space, I might say:  “We don’t have to stay long. You don’t need to be impressive. Just be.”During the interaction:  “I know it’s a lot. You’re doing really well. I’m proud of you.”And afterward, maybe:  “Thank you for trusting me. I know that was hard.”🛡️ 3. Let the adult make the callThe child might want to stay longer, win approval, be liked.But the adult can say:  “We’re leaving now, because we matter too.”Setting limits — like staying for only 90 minutes, or taking a break halfway through — isn’t avoidance. It’s care.It teaches the child inside: “I won’t abandon you just to be accepted by others.”🧘 4. Anchor in the present momentLittle grounding rituals help.A breath. A hand on the chest. A stone in my pocket. Feeling my feet.These things remind me:  “I’m here now. I’m not alone. I’m not back there.”And if I do go back there, that’s okay too. I just don’t have to stay there.💌 5. Debrief like a good parent wouldWhen I get home, I try not to collapse into criticism. I try to say:  “What was hard about that? What did you need? What would you want to do differently next time?”I hold the part of me that’s still learning how to be with others without losing himself.I think what I’m learning — slowly — is that carrying my inner child isn’t a burden.It’s an act of love.He trusted me enough to show up. The least I can do is show up for him in return.Not to fix.Not to shame.Just to be there.And maybe, one day, we won’t just survive social spaces.Maybe we’ll feel free in them.But for now, this is enough.For now, this is the work."

      "content": "There’s someone I’ve been drawn to lately.Not in a dramatic, consuming way — more like a quiet pull. A curiosity.She’s in a relationship. She’s busy. A parent. And in many ways, not really available — emotionally or otherwise.Still, I found myself wanting to talk to her.More than that — I found myself wanting her to want to talk to me.And I think I understand why.It wasn’t romance. Not really.It was my inner child — the part of me that once had to work for attention, that learned to earn affection in scraps, that still aches to be seen by people who can’t fully see.She reminded me of someone. Not exactly my mum, but not far off either.Always busy. Often distracted. Focused on her child, but in a way that made emotion feel like an inconvenience.She told me she doesn’t let her son cry in the car. That she tells him to hold it in.And I didn’t judge her — I know how hard parenting is — but something in me flinched.It sounded familiar.Too familiar.And then there was this moment.I was talking to her in a group. Open, present, trying to connect.And she wasn’t listening.I think I knew it somewhere deep down, but I didn’t want to believe it.That’s when someone else — someone who’s always been a bit mothering toward me — quietly said:  “She’s not listening to you.”And suddenly I saw it.The quiet reach I was making.The way I was offering myself to someone who couldn’t receive me.Not because I’m not worth listening to.But because she doesn’t have that space in her.And that’s the part that cracked open something deep:  I wasn’t drawn to her.I was drawn to the hope that maybe someone like her could finally give me the attention I never got.But she can’t. And that’s not a flaw in me.It’s just a pattern. And this time, I saw it.I don’t need to chase crumbs anymore.I don’t need to prove I’m worthy to people who aren’t capable of seeing me — not because I’m unworthy, but because they’re not present.And I’m thankful to the part of me that reached anyway.Because it led me back to myself.Back to that quiet truth:  I’m already enough.I don’t need to be listened to by the emotionally unavailable to believe I matter.I just need to listen to the part of me that’s still waiting for love to feel safe.And slowly, I’m doing that."

      "content": "I’ve come to realize that my depth — emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually — might be the very thing that unsettles others. And while that used to cause me to shrink or self-edit, it doesn’t anymore. I’m done watering myself down for comfort.Yes, it’s isolating. Yes, it hurts when people pull away after I’ve opened myself. I’ve seen it so many times: I go deeper, and they disappear. They find justifications — life’s too busy, or we’re not aligned anymore. But on a gut level, I know the real reason. My presence, my honesty, my emotional fluency — they stir things in people. Sometimes things they’re not ready to face. And I’ve stopped trying to fix that.Carl Jung once said that people will do anything to avoid confronting their own soul. And when someone like me shows up — deeply attuned, honest, grounded in pain transformed into clarity — it’s a mirror. And not everyone is ready for that reflection. I’m not trying to be special; it’s just the way my life has shaped me. It’s like Jung would tell me: I’m becoming who I truly am by facing my own unconscious directly — and that kind of courage disrupts those still running from theirs.Carl Rogers, if he were here, would probably remind me that I’m growing through the one thing most people avoid: being real in the presence of others. That it is the conditions for growth — congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathy — that I’m learning to embody not just in therapy, but in how I relate to myself. And that this realness, even when lonely, is my gift — not my curse.Albert Ellis, on the other hand, wouldn’t let me sit too long in the ache. He’d say, “Okay — so you want to be seen and accepted. Great. Welcome to the club. But is it a need or a preference? Because if you’re telling yourself you must be met in this life to be okay, you’re already screwed.” He’d remind me that it’s not awful to be alone, it’s just uncomfortable — and discomfort won’t kill me. It will clarify me.And then there’s Brené Brown, who I think would soften all this. She’d say: “You’re not too much — you’re just living unarmored in a world that rewards performance over presence.” I think she’d remind me that vulnerability isn’t weakness — it’s the most accurate measure of courage. And she’d probably say that my willingness to keep showing up, to risk being seen, to name the ache — that’s belonging, even if no one else is there yet.Brené would name the shame. The part of me that wants to be loved, to be seen, to be understood. The part that fears rejection but dares anyway. And she’d say that the antidote to that shame is not pretending I don’t want to be met — it’s owning the desire without letting it define my worth.There’s a moment I keep coming back to — the image of all the people who’ve slipped away when I finally revealed myself. It used to make me think I was the problem. Now I know: that moment isn’t proof of my failure — it’s proof of my integrity. I kept showing up anyway. I still am.There’s also something quietly profound I’ve noticed lately: I’m seen by my tutors. Not because I performed, not because I impressed — but because they noticed my realness. They saw me. And they didn’t name a quality, or a talent, or a success. They named honesty. That’s what I’m most proud of.And this is the therapist I’m becoming. Yes, I’ll understand modalities, somatic work, trauma theory. But more than anything, I’ll be present. Because presence — real, grounded, honest presence — is what dissolves shame. I’ve seen it. I’ve lived it. I’m becoming it.The website I’m building is not just a project. It’s a permission slip. For me. For my son. For anyone who’s ever felt too much or too unseen. Yes, a part of me wishes that everyone from my past could see it and suddenly understand. But I know that’s fantasy. The deeper truth is: I’m doing this for me. If others see me more clearly through it — fine. If they don’t — fine. I’m no longer abandoning myself for the comfort of others.And if I remain different — if I’m always a little too much, a little too sensitive, a little too honest — then so be it. Because I’ve sat with my darkness so long, I’ve fallen in love with it.This is a homecoming.And whatever comes after that — even if it’s solitude — will be met with open arms."

That’s what real giving looks like—when healing yourself helps others heal too.That last line landed deeply in my chest.It came from somewhere deeper than logic.That’s when I know it’s the truth.And maybe for the first time, I don’t feel alone.Because I’ve got me now.And yeah, that might sound cliché—but it’s honest.I don’t fear being alone.I fear being around people who make me feel alone.People like Will.Connor.The guy in Chile. The guy in Australia.My mum. My sister.Some neighbours.Different names, same pattern:  They lacked the emotional depth I need to feel seen.And when I’m with people like that, I start questioning myself.Am I too much? Am I not enough?But I know now—that’s just fear.False evidence appearing real.So I’m making space.Clearing out what was never a match, so what is can finally arrive.I’m letting go of the echo chambers of my past.And I’m opening to something better.Not louder. Not flashier. Just… deeper.Kinder. Truer. Present.Because I deserve that.And I’m no longer settling for anything less.So where do I go now?I don’t know.But I do know this:  I’m not going back."

      "content": "I woke up just before midnight with a quiet knowing — a subtle pull in my chest, like something had already been decided. I checked my phone, and there it was: Dave wasn’t coming tomorrow.It wasn’t a surprise, not really. My body had already known. It’s happened before — this feeling of someone pulling away before they say it out loud. It’s not an abandonment wound, and it’s not insecurity. It’s a kind of deep, bodily awareness I’ve developed over time. A skill, really — one that comes from having to feel what isn’t being said. A kind of emotional radar that rarely misses.And when it hits… it hits quietly. A familiar sadness. A sense of, “Here we are again.” Someone I hoped to connect with pulling back. Drifting. Dissolving. No big fallout. Just space where there used to be potential.It reminds me of others — Simon, for instance. I invited him on a trip years ago, and all the way up to the last minute, he said yes. And still, I knew he’d pull out. And he did. That same felt sense that something was slipping, even while words tried to say otherwise.It’s hard not to internalize that. It’s hard not to wonder if, somehow, I keep pushing people away. Because I do keep showing up. I share openly. I try to stay connected. I name my needs without demanding anything. I reveal the layers people usually hide. And still… they leave.So I get why, for so many years, I stayed small. Being small meant being palatable. Being small meant being kept. And now, the more I grow — the more honest I become — the more I seem to invite people to step back. Not everyone, but enough to make me wonder.And I think that’s the price of being real. Of showing up in a world that’s terrified of depth. People say they want authenticity until they meet it face-to-face — and then it gets quiet.I don’t think people leave because they dislike me. Maybe I just stir something in them they’re not ready to look at. Maybe I remind them of their own fear, or potential, or pain. I used to think rejection meant I was wrong. Now I think it just means they’re not ready.Still, it’s confusing. There are people on my course who are kind — but their kindness feels polished, people-pleasing. I don’t know if they truly see me. Maybe they connect with me in the way they’re capable of. Maybe that’s all it is. But it leaves me longing for something else. Something mutual. Something rooted.There’s grief in being rare. Grief in having worked so hard to become more myself, only to discover that the more I show up fully, the fewer people can meet me there.But still — I show up.Still, I trust my body.Still, I let the truth come out, even when it costs me something.Because I’ve also seen what happens when I don’t. And that cost is far greater.Maybe the lesson isn’t about losing Dave, or Simon, or anyone else. Maybe it’s about learning to trust myself so deeply that when I feel the distance growing, I can let it go with dignity. I can stop chasing. I can stop questioning my sanity. I can name the sadness and let it move through me — not as a failure, but as a sign that I’m on the right path. The lonelier, quieter path of those who refuse to abandon themselves to be loved.And maybe — just maybe — the rarest connections come not when I reach for them, but when I’ve stopped trying to be understood by those who can’t.Because the truth is, I am becoming someone I can trust.And that matters more than being kept."

      "url": "/blog/when-everything-rises-at-once/",
      "date": "June 10, 2025",
      "content": "There are some days where everything rises at once.Not just one memory, not one part, not one emotion—but a chorus of voices, all surfacing at the same time, all asking to be seen. It’s overwhelming. And there’s a fear in that—that if I don’t write them down, I might lose them.But maybe the fear isn’t about forgetting.Maybe it’s about trusting that the parts of me that matter will rise again when they’re ready.Lately, I’ve been thinking about the girl at college.What it meant to be seen by her. To desire. To hope. To be misunderstood, and still stay.Yes, I projected a little.But we worked through it. And what I feared—losing the ability to be myself—was actually what I found in the letting go.There was grief, of course. A loss of something imagined.But underneath it all was something quiet and beautiful:  Even in the face of disconnection, I didn’t abandon myself.Then there’s my son.He’s been pushing me lately. Testing limits. Asking for pancakes that are impossibly thin but not crispy. Moaning about everything.And I realised—I may have given him too much permission to moan.Not in a harmful way, but in a way that blurred the lines between expression and entitlement.So I pointed it out gently, and to my surprise, he said:  “I do kind of enjoy moaning a little bit.”That’s more self-awareness than most adults have. And it reminded me—he’s not here to be perfect. He’s here to grow.And so am I.Maybe modeling strength for him isn’t about being flawless.Maybe it’s about being firm and kind at the same time.Then another part surfaced—the one that panics if I don’t document all of this.The one that says: “What if you lose this clarity forever?”But I’ve seen what happens when I trust.The Jiu-Jitsu reflection took years to come through fully—and it did.My unconscious didn’t forget.It waited until I was ready.So I’m learning to trust the process.To let parts rise and fall, knowing the truth doesn’t evaporate. It integrates.And yes, there’s still a voice—the critical one.It wants me to go back and re-edit every post. Make it neater, more refined, more “professional.”But I know what that is.It’s the part of me that’s still afraid to be seen in process.Afraid that if it’s not polished, it’s not worthy.But healing isn’t a finished product.It’s messy. Unfolding. Honest.And sometimes, the rawest things are the ones that resonate most.So this is what today looked like:  A boy who’s learning how to moan less.  A man who’s learning how to hold boundaries without shutting down softness.  A father who’s trying to be a safe mirror, not a flawless one.  A human who is still grieving, still desiring, still creating space for all that rises—at once.I don’t need to hold every insight forever.I just need to meet it while it’s here.And trust that whatever matters…will rise again."

      "content": "There’s been a quiet voice in me whispering, “You should be working on the website.” But instead, I’m here — sat on the sofa, cup of tea in hand, dog at my side, music playing in the background. And honestly, I’m just enjoying the moment.I’ve just dropped my son off. The weight of responsibility has lifted, and there’s space to just be. Not rush. Not fix. Just breathe a little.And I realised something: I am still working on the site — just not in the visible way. The content is building slowly through the day, in thoughts, in passing ideas, in conversations I have with myself. I’m allowing the vision to develop in a subconscious, rooted way. Letting what wants to rise, rise. That might actually save me more time in the long run.I know the site’s imperfect. Some things aren’t working. But it doesn’t matter right now. Because the deeper truth is: I’m building something that reflects me. And I’m not rushing that.Uploading this post is more of a reminder to myself than to the outside world. It’s not performative. It’s not for validation. It’s a marker in time — a note to my future self: You don’t need to be afraid. It’s okay to take your time.Maybe I’ve been rushing out of fear. Fear that I won’t finish. Fear I’ll be forgotten. Fear that it has to be perfect, or fast, or impressive. But maybe — just maybe — this isn’t fear-based after all. Maybe it’s born out of love. A quieter kind of love. A love that says:  You don’t have to hurry.What’s meant for you is already unfolding.Just stay close to yourself.My dog reminds me daily — there’s no rush. She rests. She stretches. She rolls onto her back and demands love without shame. She knows her needs matter.So do mine.This project — this site — will grow at the pace my heart can handle. Not a moment faster. Not a click sooner. I’ll return to the structure when it’s time. But right now, I’m trusting the quiet work. The kind that takes root while the kettle boils and the music plays low in the background.This is the work. And it’s enough for today."

Like I can’t afford to let them see the in-between.That’s survival energy.It’s not wisdom.It’s the old voice that says, “If it’s not perfect, it’s not worthy.”But this site isn’t a pitch deck.It’s not a polished portfolio.It’s a process.A space to be honest. To grow. To heal.And if I shame myself into rushing it—into hiding the messy middle—I’m betraying the very reason this site exists.I’ve only been working on this properly for a couple of weeks.It’s a lifelong project. A living archive of emotional growth and self-trust.And if someone judges it in its current state—that’s okay.If they don’t see the potential—that’s okay too.Because I see it. I feel it.And more importantly, I know that it will get done.In my time. In my rhythm.So I’m not rushing anymore.Not because I’m lazy.But because I respect the pace at which true things are built.This site is not a performance.It’s a home.For me. For my voice. For the quiet parts that were never meant to be rushed."

      "date": "June 10, 2025",
      "content": "I woke up just before midnight with a quiet knowing — a kind of energetic shift in my body, a signal I’ve come to recognize. I knew someone I had hoped to see again wasn’t going to come tomorrow.I checked my messages, and I was right.This happens more than I like to admit — not because I’m paranoid or needy, but because something in me knows when a connection is slowly drifting away. It’s not abandonment. It’s not insecurity. It’s intuition. Subtle, embodied awareness that comes from having to feel what others wouldn’t say.It used to be devastating. Now, it’s just… sad. Familiar.Because the truth is, I really thought we had something worth exploring. A sense of mutual understanding, shared wounds, quiet resonance. But maybe I stirred something in them. Maybe my growth, my certainty, my emotional honesty made them uncomfortable in a way they couldn’t name. And so… they stepped back.I’ve seen it before. People who say yes until the last second, then quietly disappear. And somehow, my body always knows.I used to think this meant I was pushing people away. That I was too much. Now I think it’s just that my presence — my full, honest, integrated self — brings things to the surface in others. Things they aren’t ready to face. Maybe I reflect back the parts of themselves they’ve suppressed. Maybe I remind them of the freedom they’re afraid to claim.That’s not my fault. But it is lonely.I see now that I’m not isolated — I’m just separated from people who can’t meet me. And that distinction matters. I no longer collapse into myself the way I used to. I no longer interpret distance as proof that I’m unworthy. I just name the sadness, trust the feeling, and allow space for something else to come.And maybe that’s the work right now — leaving the door open without begging anyone to walk in.It’s strange how often people seem to edge away once I stop keeping myself small. I used to suppress parts of me — especially my intelligence, my articulation, the clarity with which I can express what others barely feel. I think my mum had something to do with that — her presence used to shrink me. But she’s gone now. And I’m free.And now that I’m allowing myself to speak from my full intelligence, both intellectual and emotional, I’m seeing just how rare this combination is — especially in a man. I’m incredibly emotionally sensitive, perceptive, intuitive. And I’m also incredibly articulate. That’s not arrogance — it’s just true. And it can be incredibly isolating.Because I’m not just feeling deeply — I’m seeing things other people seem to miss. Patterns. Nuances. Unspoken signals. I’ve developed what feels like a sixth sense — probably born of trauma, yes, but honed into something that actually helps me live with more honesty.I think the tutors on my course see it. Maybe because they’ve done more inner work. Maybe because they’ve read my assignments and recognised what I’ve been through. They see something different in me. A depth. A clarity. A readiness. And for the first time, I think I’m starting to see it too.I used to think I had to justify my place. That I had to prove I belonged. But my Level 4 interview wasn’t about proving anything. It was just about showing up. And I did. Fully. Honestly. I didn’t need to convince anyone — I just needed to see myself clearly. And I did.And maybe, just maybe, allowing myself to be fully seen — publicly seen — through this website, through sharing my truth so openly, was the quiet tipping point that made some people pull away. Maybe I stirred something in them that they weren’t ready to sit with. Maybe it cracked something open — something spiritual, something tender — and they just didn’t want to be around it. I don’t think it was malicious. I just think it was too much for them right now.And maybe they won’t continue this journey — even if they have the chance. Not because they aren’t capable, but because going deeper might mean facing things they’re not ready to face. Severing ties with old stories. Stepping into a version of themselves they’re not ready to claim. That’s not a judgment — it’s just what I see. And it’s okay. It’s just… disappointing. A little sad.But something is different now.Because I’m still showing up.I’m still letting myself be seen — even when it stirs something in others.I’m still keeping the door open — even when I suspect most won’t walk through it.Because maybe the point isn’t to be met by everyone. Maybe it’s to stop abandoning myself in the hopes that I will be.Maybe this part of my life is about standing in my wholeness — even when that wholeness is confronting, misunderstood, or left unread.And actually — not everyone has walked away. There are people on my course who see me. Not because I ticked a box or did something impressive, but because they feel something in me that’s real. They’ve commented on my honesty. My realness. Not a skill or a label — my essence. And that’s the most validating thing I could hope for, because those are the qualities I’ve worked the hardest to reclaim.Stripping away all that conditioning hasn’t been easy. But I think I’ve landed in a place where people can feel that I’m being honest. And maybe that does intimidate some — but it also draws others closer. And I want to welcome them in, fully. With both arms.Because I’ve sat with my darkness long enough to fall in love with it.And now that I have, I don’t need to beg anyone to stay.And still — there’s something else I’m feeling.A fear I haven’t named until now.The fear of being seen.And deeper than that, the shame of even wanting to be seen.That’s what’s really here, quietly humming beneath the surface. Because somewhere along the way, that longing to be witnessed became tied to weakness. Maybe I was taught it was needy. Or selfish. Or dangerous. That wanting to be seen meant being vulnerable, exposed — unsafe.But I do want to be seen. Not for who I pretend to be — but for who I am. And I’m no longer ashamed of that.Because that desire is not weakness. It’s human. It’s holy.And now, I think of my son.And how he, too, will probably carry this depth. He’s already so bright, so emotionally aware — so clearly more than the world might be ready for. And it worries me sometimes. Because I know how lonely that can be.But he has something I didn’t: me.He has a father who sees it. Who’s lived it. Who’s walked through the storm and kept going.I believe he will find his place. I believe he will find people who meet him.And until then, I will be his place.And maybe one last thing — there’s a part of me that still wishes that all the people I’ve ever known would somehow understand me when they read this site.I know that’s not realistic. I know many won’t look. Some might look and not really see. And others might feel something uncomfortable reflected back at them — something they’re not ready to face.But still… that part of me hopes. The one that just wants to be loved and accepted for who I am. The part that’s always hoped.And maybe, for a long time, I was afraid that hope was secretly driving all of this — that this project was some covert attempt to finally earn belonging.But I don’t think that’s true anymore.Because I know now, in my body, in my breath, that I’m doing this for me.I’m doing it to anchor myself. To honour the truth. To show up for my own soul.And yes — if someone sees me more clearly through this work, that’s beautiful.But if not?I will keep going anyway."

      "content": "I keep waking up early. Not from stress or noise—but something deeper. A voice inside. A part of me I had buried. Maybe my inner child. And it’s showing me things I didn’t want to see. Memories I suppressed because they were just too much.It’s beginning to dawn on me—really, fully—that I didn’t have any love in my childhood. None. My family system was so fundamentally unsafe that I couldn’t even believe them when they occasionally showed warmth. I had already learned not to trust the hand that hits and hugs in the same breath.I spent so much of my life idealizing my parents, hoping—praying—that maybe I’d gotten it wrong. Maybe they did love me. Maybe they just didn’t know how to show it. But the truth is… they didn’t. Not really. Not in the ways a child needs. And certainly not in the ways I begged for, silently, for years.My mum never said she loved me. Not once.She never held space for me without eventually lashing out. When I achieved something, she couldn’t reflect joy back to me. She’d feel threatened instead. What kind of mother does that?I know now: a mother who hates herself. And instead of facing it, she projected it. Onto me.That’s the cruelest thing you can do to a child—make them carry your self-hatred.And somehow, I survived that.For a while, I thought maybe my dad saw what was happening. That maybe, deep down, he understood and cared. But that’s another story I made up to survive.The truth? He lived through the same thing. He knew the pain—and still, he did nothing. He failed me. He isolated himself. He gave up on life. And he gave up on me.And honestly, that’s what sent me into psychosis. Not madness. Grief. Soul-shattering grief. And the unbearable loneliness of finally seeing the truth and having no one there to hold it with me.My friends didn’t get it. They said I was being dramatic. That my mum seemed lovely. So I wasn’t just abused—I was disbelieved.No one saw me. No one stood up for me. No one helped.So I did what anyone would do if their reality was too much to bear.I created a different one.I told myself a story. That my dad loved me. That he left me signs. That my life meant something more than pain. And for one brief moment, I believed it.And that story? That fantasy? It saved my life.I didn’t go insane that night—I chose something else. I made a world where I wasn’t invisible. Where I was loved. Where I mattered.And yeah, I smoked weed and listened to Eminem. A lot. Because he got it. He put words to what I couldn’t say. He screamed the truth I had buried. His music felt like the only thing that knew how much I hurt.People said I was crazy for that too. But they didn’t grow up like I did. They didn’t need it to stay alive.There’s a part of me that will probably always carry rage. Not because I’m bitter—but because I know now that I deserved better.And I’ll spend the rest of my life honoring how badly I was treated.Not to stay stuck in it.But because telling the truth is how I finally become free."

      "content": "I’m starting to see the patterns now.The ways my mum kept me from seeing the truth clearly weren’t accidental—they were practiced. Rehearsed. Like go-to moves she knew would work on me.The first was always to minimize. Whatever I brought up—feelings, concerns, pain—she’d say it wasn’t a big deal. Dismiss it outright. Like everything I said was dramatic, overblown, or just not important enough to register.The second was comparison. “Well, so-and-so went through worse.” Or, “they turned out fine, why can’t you?” As if someone else’s resilience or silence somehow canceled out my pain. It made no sense. But as a kid, I tried to believe it—because believing it meant I could still believe my mum loved me.And what child wouldn’t want to believe that?But it didn’t stop there. Her most effective, and most manipulative move, was apologizing before anything even happened.She’d say sorry in this pitiful, anticipatory way. And somehow, even before I opened my mouth, I felt guilty. Like I’d hurt her just by existing. Like I was the problem. She never changed her behavior. The apologies weren’t real. They were a preemptive guilt trap. And I fell for it so many times—it’s embarrassing.Except… maybe it’s not.The more I grew into myself, the more she shifted her tactics. If she sensed she was losing my attention—losing the emotional pull—something strange would happen. She’d get hurt. Or fall. Usually in a way that could somehow be traced back to me.Once, we visited a waterfall. I warned her the path was a bit sketchy, but she insisted she could handle it. When we stopped for a picture, she edged herself backward, slowly, into a fall. It looked fake. Like she chose a safe place to fall—just enough to dramatize, not enough to get hurt. And then came the guilt trip: “Well, you shouldn’t have brought me down here.”Another time, she was on the decking I’d built. I told her to be careful—there weren’t planters at the edge yet. She backed her chair right off it and fell into the fence. It was dramatic. Coordinated, almost. And again, the look—like I’d failed her somehow. Like she was the victim of my carelessness.And in the moment, I did feel guilty.But now? I don’t.Now, I see it clearly.I see how these “falls” weren’t just physical. They were cries for attention, bids for control, guilt grenades lobbed into the spaces where I was finally stepping back.And yeah, I used to feel embarrassed about it. Embarrassed that I fell for it. That I didn’t see through it sooner. That I believed her apologies meant something. That I trusted her.But maybe that’s not embarrassment.Maybe that’s just deeply, deeply, deeply sad on a primal level."

      "content": "There was a brown belt I used to roll with. Honestly, he was a bit chaotic. Full of testosterone, full of something else too—a wounded boy trying to assert himself through bravado. I could see it clearly, probably because I’ve done my own work. His jesting and mocking hit something raw in me, and I acted. I took him down—clean, decisive.He didn’t expect it. But his ego didn’t take it well either.And that’s when it happened. He locked my knee. No warning. No space to tap. It wasn’t technique. It was punishment. I’d hurt his ego, and he hurt my body. I limped for days. I couldn’t walk my son to school the next morning.That was the moment I knew:This isn’t just a sport. And it’s not safe for me anymore.The truth is, I had known for a while. Not consciously, maybe. But somewhere in me, I felt the misalignment.When my coach once hurt my wrist, it had already planted the seed. It wasn’t malicious—it just reminded me that my body isn’t built to absorb this kind of strain. I even found out I had arthritis. But I strapped on a wrist guard and kept going.Why? Because Jiu-Jitsu gave me something I didn’t have anywhere else at the time: structure. Connection. A place to show up and be seen, even if it was through discomfort.And that’s part of the story that matters most:  I wasn’t there to conquer. I was there because I was lonely.It’s taken me years to realise how often I’ve stayed too long in places that didn’t fit, just because they were all I had. When you’re raised to suppress your needs, override your instincts, and try harder no matter what—it becomes hard to know when to stop.But life has a way of stopping you.And my knee injury became that moment of stillness.Of reflection.Of letting go.When I returned the second time, I knew it immediately:It’s not fun.It’s not healing.It’s not me.And I didn’t need to shame myself for not seeing it sooner.Because for someone like me, sometimes it takes staying until the pain becomes undeniable to learn how to finally listen to myself.So, this isn’t a post about quitting.It’s a post about choosing.I chose myself.My body.My time.My joy.And I’ll never again prove my worth by enduring things that hurt me.That’s what Jiu-Jitsu taught me.And that’s the day I left the mat. To the version of me who stayed too long—You weren’t weak. You were loyal.You didn’t miss the signs. You overrode them for connection, because that’s how you survived.I see now that you didn’t need to win at Jiu-Jitsu.You needed to feel seen. Safe. Respected.And when it stopped offering that, you didn’t fail by walking away—You finally succeeded in listening to the part of you that had never been listened to before.To anyone reading this who’s in something that no longer fits—a relationship, a routine, a role you’ve outgrown—you’re allowed to stop trying.You’re allowed to choose peace over proving.You’re allowed to say,  “This isn’t for me,”without needing a better reason than that.Sometimes the bravest thing isn’t holding on.It’s letting go with grace.And if you need someone to say it’s okay—Here it is.It’s okay to walk away."

Not as broken or lost, but as someone undergoing the slow fire of individuation.  “You are not going mad. You are becoming whole.”He’d remind me that few people walk this path — the one that requires confrontation with the soul. That’s why people are pulling away. It’s not because I’m wrong. It’s because I’m revealing. And many can’t bear to face their own inner world. So my presence, my honesty, my evolution — it stirs something. Something uncomfortable.  “Do not strive to be understood by all. Strive to be whole.”He would honour the part of me that still longs to be seen by those from my past. That small fantasy: Maybe if they just read the words on my website, they’d understand me. He wouldn’t shame that. He’d just help me see it for what it is — a residue of the child who never had a mirror. And he’d gently invite me to become that mirror now.  “You are not here to fit in. You are here to become.”And then I imagine Carl Rogers would enter the room, quiet and steady, and he wouldn’t say much at first. He’d just sit with me. Let my words fall. Let my silences stretch.He wouldn’t pathologize me for being tired, or for wishing someone would see the whole of me and stay. He’d reflect it gently, the way only Rogers could.  “You are not broken. You are just real.”He’d help me soften the shame I feel around wanting to be understood. He’d tell me that longing doesn’t make me needy. It makes me human. And he’d offer the kind of presence that says: You don’t have to be any different for me to stay here with you.  “The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.”And in that silence — that holding — something in me would exhale.I think what I’m coming to realise is this:This is the therapist I want to become.Yes, I want to understand the somatic practices.Yes, I want to know the theory, the models, the maps.But I think what I value most is the power of presence.Because presence — real, congruent, grounded presence — does something no technique ever can:It alleviates shame.It makes the unbearable bearable.It tells someone: You are not alone in this.And maybe that’s why this ache I carry feels so purposeful.Because the more I welcome myself in the moments no one else does, the more I’ll be able to welcome others in their own shadowy places.The counsellors in my head remind me:You don’t have to be perfect.You just have to stay.So I will stay.And I will become."

Like my inner child is finally free to speak—and he’s got a lot to say.And the thing is: I believe him now. I don’t push him away. I don’t shame him for still hoping, still needing, still aching. I just listen. Because he’s never really been listened to before.For so long, I buried it all. I didn’t know how else to survive. The grief. The neglect. The loneliness. The shame.And yeah, I looked for love in ways that weren’t always healthy. But I don’t feel ashamed of that anymore. Because what else was I meant to do? The need to be loved, to be seen, to be accepted—it’s primal. And no child should ever feel ashamed for needing love.Now, as an adult, it’s my responsibility to hold those parts. To integrate them. To be the one I always needed. And I do that not just to protect myself—but so I can stay responsible with the strength I’ve always had.Because I didn’t grow up with integrity modeled for me.But somehow… I had it anyway.And it might’ve made my life harder.But it also made it mine.There’s a part of me—quiet, strong, firm—that never let go. It’s the part that got me into therapy. The part that whispered, you deserve care. The part that knew life could be different, even when everything around me said otherwise.And honestly, if that part of me didn’t exist, I wouldn’t be here.That’s not an exaggeration. That’s just the truth.There were many moments I thought: If this is what life is, why keep living it?And I get it. I understand why people take their lives. My best friend did. When I was around 27, 28. And I don’t judge him. I don’t think he was weak. I think he was in pain. Real, unprocessed pain. I just wish I could’ve helped him. But at the time, I was still deep in my own.And maybe that’s why I want to become a counsellor or a therapist. Because I know what safety and trust can do for someone. I know how powerful it is to be seen—without fear, without judgment.Sometimes, that’s all it takes to save a life.I don’t know when this purge will end.Maybe it won’t. Maybe it’ll just change shape.But I trust it now.Because I finally know this isn’t breaking down.It’s breaking through."

Just a loss of all control. They injected me with drugs while I was emotionally overwhelmed. But I wasn’t violent. I wasn’t a threat. I was just deep in grief. And they didn’t know what to do with that.Maybe it was because I wasn’t Spanish. Maybe it was fear. But it felt like I lost my autonomy, my humanity—and no one cared. Just get him under control.But maybe this goes back even further.To childhood. To moments where my dad would overpower me. Not in play. But with a kind of satisfaction. Like he enjoyed knowing he could control me. That I couldn’t fight back. That he owned the room, my fear, my silence.And so I did what so many kids do to survive:I ate.I bulked up.I grew into something stronger.Something that couldn’t be messed with anymore.By the time I was 12 or 13, I had that power. And one day, I used it. I shoved my dad to the floor of our kitchen. Hard floor. Loud fall. And I stood over him, fists ready.I could’ve beaten the shit out of him. And a part of me wanted to. For everything.But I didn’t.I mercied him.And I don’t know why.Maybe I saw that he was fragile. That he was already broken. Maybe I saw him as a little boy then. Or maybe it was just something in me that refused to become what he was.Not because someone taught me integrity. But because it was already in me.Sometimes I wonder if I should’ve hit him. If maybe he deserved it.But the truth is… I didn’t need to.The fact that I could have—and didn’t—that’s power. That’s control. That’s the kind of strength no one could take from me. Not even him.And maybe that’s what enraged my parents most. That the best parts of me—the quiet strength, the refusal to become cruel, the ability to grow out of the shame they fed me—triggered them. Because they couldn’t do it themselves.This hate I feel? Sometimes it’s not really hate.It’s memory.It’s the body remembering what it felt like to be helpless—and never protected.It’s my nervous system screaming for justice in places I never got it.And maybe, in that kitchen, I gave myself the first taste of it.Not by fighting back.But by choosing who I was going to be."

He’s growing. Testing. Pushing.And lately, I’ve noticed him moaning more, asking for things that are intentionally difficult or impossible—like pancakes that are thin but not crispy, or complaining when I ask him to check his phone before I leave for a dog walk, even though he told me he felt lonely last time.There’s part of me that used to say:  “It’s fine—he’s just six. He’s just seven.”And yes, some of that behaviour is age-appropriate.But another part of me knows:He understands.He knows when he’s being disrespectful.He knows when he’s testing limits.And he knows, now, when I’m not okay with it.What changed is that I stopped feeling shame for being annoyed.I stopped thinking I had to be endlessly patient to be a good father.I started seeing that saying “That’s not okay” is also saying:  “I matter too.”“You don’t need to perform for love—but you also don’t get to treat people poorly.”“Love includes respect, on both sides.”He even admitted it once:  “I kind of enjoy moaning.”And that honesty gave me hope.He’s not bad. He’s not broken.He’s just human—like me.And what he needs isn’t a flawless parent.He needs someone anchored enough to say no.To hold firm.To show him what self-respect looks like in real time, even with someone I love more than anything.I used to think love meant self-sacrifice.Now I think it means showing up honestly.So when I say, “Don’t speak to me like that,”I’m not pushing him away.I’m giving him the most powerful gift I know:A model of a man who knows his worth, and still leads with love.Because the truth is—I don’t want him to learn that love means tolerating disrespect.I want him to feel the kind of love that’s strong, clear, and safe enough to say:  “I care about you deeply.And I also care about myself.”That’s what I want to give him.That’s what I wish I had learned earlier.And that’s the kind of father I’m becoming."

I thought facing the truth of my childhood would break me—and it did, in ways—but now that I’ve been drip-fed the grief and rage and loneliness over time… it’s just there. Real. But not drowning me.There’s a kind of indifference that’s not numb—it’s acceptance.And that’s changing everything.Yesterday, at the dentist, something small happened—but it stuck with me. She asked about my life, and I mentioned I build websites. Her whole tone shifted. She shared how hers was costing too much, how she felt overwhelmed. And for a moment, she looked almost childlike. Vulnerable. Like she half-expected me to mock her confusion.But instead, I met her where she was. I didn’t fix it for her. I told her how I would’ve asked the same questions to ChatGPT, even shared tips—like asking it to speak to her like she’s eight years old. And at first, she hesitated. Maybe she thought I was brushing her off.But then something clicked. Her guard dropped. She actually opened it there and then and tried it.It wasn’t about the website. It was about being seen in a place she felt insecure—and met with kindness instead of superiority. That kind of interaction… it used to be rare for me. Now it’s almost normal.And it wasn’t just her. Every interaction that day felt more honest. More real.Not because other people changed—but because I’m not leading with that wounded part of me anymore. He’s still there, but he’s not driving the car. The fear that “if I don’t get connection, I’ll die” doesn’t rule me now. That was the child in me screaming for love.But I’m not a child anymore. I’m an adult. I can hold myself now. And I do.And oddly, that very truth—that I don’t need anyone to rescue me—is exactly what makes connection feel better. Because when it happens, it’s not about filling a void. It’s just a gift. A shared moment between two humans. No grasping. No proving. Just presence.I don’t need fake connection anymore. I enjoy the real thing—but I’m not desperate for it. And that’s the paradox: the less I need it, the more it comes.Integration is quiet like that."

It wasn’t even the most painful. But it was the last. And that made it symbolic. It marked the end of a cycle — the old me, the one who tolerated, who waited to be seen, who stayed loyal to people who didn’t actually see me at all.I’ve let go of them all now. My mother, and every other person whose presence kept me tied to a version of myself I’ve outgrown. Some of them once meant a lot to me. Some of them probably still care, in their own way. But none of them have grown with me. None of them could meet me where I am now. And that’s okay.What surprises me most is the feeling that came after. Not grief. Not guilt.Excitement.For the first time, my life feels like it’s mine. My energy isn’t tied up in managing, fixing, or proving. I’ve cut the ties to people who were surprised by my clarity — and that, in itself, showed how little they really saw.They might have meant well.They might have loved me in the ways they knew how.But I love me better now. And I get to choose what love looks like moving forward.I know no one will clap for this moment. There’s no parade for choosing peace. No standing ovation for inner alignment. But I’m clapping. Quietly, deeply, with reverence. Because I know what this took.This is the kind of freedom no one gives you.You have to take it.And I just did."

You were. And someone else felt it too.That’s what music has done for me.It hasn’t necessarily healed me.But it has comforted me.It’s sat beside me in silence.It’s said, without words: “You’re not alone in this.”It’s helped me rediscover parts of myself—memories and feelings held in my nervous system long before I had the tools to understand them.Looking back now, I realise just how devastatingly lonely my childhood really was.I used to dance to keep from falling apart.I used to convince myself I was loved when my body knew I wasn’t.And sometimes, I lost my sanity in trying to maintain that illusion.But music remembered what I couldn’t.It held it for me until I was ready to return to it with more compassion.Music, to me, is one of the most beautiful forms of human communication.It doesn’t need explanation.It just is—it bypasses logic and goes straight to the place where the soul lives.It unearths something primal in us. Our power to feel. Our capacity to love. Our connection to ourselves and each other.This has existed for thousands, maybe millions of years—long before this capitalist machine we’re all navigating now.Music is older than shame.Older than suppression.Older than forgetting.It’s a rhythm that reminds us we’re still here.That we’ve always been here.And that our feelings are worth listening to.So no—music didn’t fix me.But it found me.And that was enough."

Something to be hardened, hidden, or overcome.But what if that was never true?What if it wasn’t a wound…What if it was just me?I’ve never liked hurting people. Even in settings where it was expected—like Jiu-Jitsu—I felt that hesitation in my body. A kind of quiet refusal to dominate, even when I technically could.That part of me used to make me feel ashamed.Was I weak? Was I scared? Was I broken?But now, with space and reflection, I realise:  I wasn’t broken. I was whole. I just didn’t live in a world that knew how to receive me.Yes, maybe trauma shaped how sharply I feel things.But the ability to feel deeply itself? That didn’t come from pain. That came from me.From the beginning, I’ve been tuned in—emotionally attuned, observant, subtle.And yes, it made me different.But it’s also what makes me a good father. A strong communicator. A safe space. A future counsellor.This trait I was taught to fear?It’s my greatest strength.And now, finally, I’ve found places where it’s not just tolerated—it’s revered.In therapeutic work.In real friendships.In love that doesn’t require masks.I don’t have to perform. I don’t have to prove.I just get to be.Sure, part of me wishes I’d figured this out sooner.But I understand now why it took time.I had to walk enough circles, bump into enough walls, hurt enough times—to really accept this part of me, not just tolerate it.And now that I have?I wouldn’t trade my sensitivity for anything.To anyone who’s felt “too much” their whole life—Maybe it’s not a flaw.Maybe it’s not the residue of trauma.Maybe it’s your deepest truth, waiting for your permission to stay soft in a hard world.And if no one ever told you this before—You don’t have to change.

Pushed through. Tried to belong.Until one day, I didn’t.I stopped forcing. I stopped justifying. I left.And in that moment, I honoured myself more than I ever had on the mat.There was a guy there—unstable, unconscious, stuck in wounded child energy.He used to call me a “pussy,” but I realised later…That’s just how he talked to himself.He projected that shame outward because it was eating him alive inside.That’s why he never left the mat.It was the only place where he could feel powerful.And when someone like me—quiet, new, grounded—showed up and didn’t flinch, he couldn’t handle it.He said I was weak.But deep down, I think he knew:  I was one of the strongest people he’d ever rolled with—not just physically, but internally.That bothered him. Because I didn’t need the mat to feel like someone.I think that’s why he hurt me the way he did.He needed to overpower me to feel real.But all it showed me was how fragile that performance of strength really was.Taking testosterone. Acting out. Mocking others.It was all armour for an invisible little boy who never felt seen.And yeah—being around that kind of energy is dangerous.Because when you remind someone of the parts they’ve buried, they don’t always thank you.They retaliate.But here’s what matters:I didn’t become like him.I didn’t fight for dominance or lose myself trying to prove something.I listened. I left. I chose safety.And that, more than any submission or stripe, is how I know I’ve grown.My body has always known the truth.It knew when I wasn’t safe.It knew when I was being disrespected.It knew when I was overriding my own instincts to belong.And now?I honour that wisdom. I trust it.And I don’t need to be in spaces that punish me for listening to it.Because real strength is knowing when to walk away.And I walked away from the mat—not because I was weak,but because I finally understood how strong I really am."

I thought that might be my path too.But as I’ve grown, I’ve realised something.I don’t have to be Eminem.I’m not him.We might share a sense of emotional bankruptcy early in life, but we’re different.Different energy. Different tone. Different calling.Where his path led him into battle bars and brutal self-exposure, mine has led me into something quieter, maybe even more reflective.I’m not here to dominate a stage.I’m here to hold space.I’ve found other strengths—building websites, shaping ideas, writing honestly, creating gentle spaces for people to feel less alone.And that’s where I can still bring music in.Not as a performer, but as a guide.Not to be impressive, but to be useful.If someone listens to a song and it hits them deeply, I want to help them explore why.I want to ask what their body remembers that their mind doesn’t.I want to help them feel what I felt when a line of music sliced through the noise and told me something I hadn’t been able to say aloud.That’s still a form of healing.That’s still reducing suffering.That’s still powerful.So maybe I do have a little bit of a rapper in me.And maybe one day I’ll play with that.But I’m not taking it too seriously.Because the truth is:  I already have a voice.I already have a mission.And I’m finally using it—my way."

      "url": "/blog/healing-the-mother-complex/",
      "date": "June 10, 2025",
      "content": "There’s a quiet ache in many of us — a longing to be seen, nurtured, held. For some, that ache points toward the mother. Not just our personal mother, but the Mother in a deeper, archetypal sense. In Jungian psychology, this is what’s known as the Mother Complex — a potent, sometimes unconscious pattern that binds us in ways we can’t fully explain.This post is my attempt to name that pattern — to trace how it shaped my life, the cost of it, and how I’ve been slowly and painfully finding freedom.The Roots of the ComplexJung described the mother complex as a psychic imprint — a deep, internalized structure formed through our relationship with the personal mother or the lack thereof. If our mother was emotionally absent, engulfing, shaming, overly self-sacrificing, or manipulative, that complex can distort how we relate to nurturing, to vulnerability, and to ourselves.For me, the mother wound wasn’t born of overt cruelty — it was the absence of kindness, the inconsistent presence, the love that came with conditions. I learned early that my emotions were too much, my sensitivity inconvenient, and my needs a burden.So I did what many do: I became good. I shrank myself. I suppressed my anger. I sought approval by abandoning my authenticity. I made sure not to take up too much space.But inside, I was starving.How the Complex Showed UpThe mother complex followed me into adulthood in subtle and not-so-subtle ways:  I sought connection with people who echoed her emotional unavailability, hoping this time it would be different.  I dismissed my own needs, believing I had to be self-sufficient to be lovable.  I gravitated toward caretaking roles, feeling responsible for other people’s comfort.  And underneath it all, I had a persistent sense that something was wrong with me — that I was too much, or not enough, or both at once.This is the tricky part: the complex isn’t just about the mother. It becomes internalized — we carry it forward ourselves. We keep repeating the patterns, unconsciously reinforcing them, unless we bring them into the light.Meeting the WoundThe turning point came when I allowed myself to stop performing and start grieving. I began acknowledging the pain of not having been nurtured the way I needed — not just intellectually, but somatically, in my body.I noticed how any boundary I set would send me spiraling into guilt. How any act of self-compassion felt selfish. How I feared being seen, but ached for it.This wasn’t just personal — it was archetypal. I was meeting the Dark Mother within me: the part of me that punished myself the way my mother once did. And to reclaim my life, I had to confront her. I had to love the parts of me she taught me to exile.Strategies That Helped Me HealThis hasn’t been a quick or linear journey. But these have been some of the most helpful steps along the way:1. Setting Boundaries Without Justifying ThemLearning to say no — not with anger, but with clarity. I stopped explaining myself to people who didn’t try to understand me.2. Reparenting My Inner ChildWhen I felt abandoned or unworthy, I stopped outsourcing love and started offering it inward. I became the kind, calm presence I never had.3. Working with a Skilled TherapistI needed someone who could hold the depth without flinching. Someone who could validate my experience while gently challenging the internalized mother-voice of shame.4. Symbolic ExpressionWriting, poetry, visual storytelling — these helped externalize what was once tangled up inside me. The act of creation gave me space to see the truth more clearly.5. Somatic PracticesEmotional healing didn’t just happen in my head. Breathwork, grounding, even simple body scans helped me release stored grief and reconnect with safety in my own body.Why I Did ItBecause I knew the cost of staying loyal to the wound.Because I didn’t want my son to inherit the same silent legacy.Because I wanted to be free — not just from my mother, but from the internalized version of her that still haunted me.And ultimately, because I began to believe — even in my loneliness — that I am worth being loved without performance.What’s Changed  I’m no longer desperate for approval.  I speak more slowly, with presence.  I feel sadness more cleanly, and I no longer run from it.  I’m building a life — and a website — that reflects who I really am, not who I was told to be.I still feel the ache sometimes. But I no longer believe it means something is wrong with me.If You’re Carrying a Similar WoundYou’re not broken — you’ve been shaped.And you can reshape. You can meet yourself in the place your mother couldn’t.You can stop the pattern without needing her to change.It takes time. It takes grief.But it is possible to come home to yourself.And that home — that quiet inner belonging — is what the mother complex was always guarding.You’re the one you’ve been waiting for."

      "url": "/blog/healing-the-father-complex/",
      "date": "June 10, 2025",
      "content": "In Jungian psychology, the Father Complex isn’t just about our literal father — it’s about what he represents. Structure. Authority. Discipline. The outer world. He is often the first gatekeeper between a child and the world beyond the home. And when that figure is distorted, absent, or terrifying, it can leave deep fractures in our psyche.For me, the Father Complex was wired with fear. His aggressive knocks on my door. His unpredictable energy. The way the house didn’t feel safe when he was around. I learned to brace. I learned to watch. I learned to make myself small, to anticipate rather than express.I didn’t grow up with a model of masculine presence that felt safe or strong. I didn’t trust male authority — not in others, and not in myself. And so for a long time, I avoided it. I rejected it. I buried it.But Jung would say what we repress doesn’t disappear — it becomes shadow. And my shadow took on many forms: avoidance, passivity, doubt in my own capability. I hesitated to lead. I feared being like him. And yet, without reclaiming some form of inner father, I remained directionless, ungrounded.What Healing Looked LikeI didn’t set out to heal the father complex — it began quietly, and in fragments.      Boundaries were my first act of inner fatherhood. Saying no. Refusing to open the door to aggressive knocks. Protecting myself, like no one had before.        Creating structure in my life — waking early, walking the dog, caring for my son, budgeting money — began to ground me. I became my own authority.        Naming the truth of what happened. I stopped sugarcoating my childhood. I acknowledged the trauma — not to blame, but to validate my inner child who felt afraid and unseen.        Letting go of inherited shame. I was never meant to carry my father’s pain, his unprocessed wounds, his emotional volatility. That’s his to hold. Not mine.        Speaking up — in therapy, in friendships, even in writing this. Each time I gave voice to what I once swallowed, I reclaimed a little more of my masculine essence.  The Gifts of HealingHealing the Father Complex didn’t make me harder. It made me steadier. It gave me a spine — not to fight, but to stand.  I can now be a present father to my own son, free from the shadows of the past.  I trust myself more deeply. I don’t need external permission to follow what I know is right.  I’ve begun to welcome healthy masculine energy — within myself and in others — as something powerful, protective, and calm.  And I’ve felt the grief, too. The grief of what I didn’t have. The grief of what I thought I had to become in order to survive.For Anyone Carrying the WoundIf you resonate with this — if your father was absent, volatile, cold, or silently distant — know this: you are not broken.You may have lived without a map, but the compass is within you. The part of you that sees clearly. That acts with integrity. That protects the parts of you that once weren’t protected.That’s your inner father.And he’s waking up.You don’t have to become your father.You can become your own."

My nervous system tired.And sometimes, I’ve had to ask his mum to take over.So on Sunday, when I’d usually have him, she looked after him.And today—Tuesday—I chose to have him, even though it’s her usual night.I wanted to honour the space she gave me, and I also felt like he needed that time with me.I believe I’ll be okay.But I also know I’m running on limited fuel.By the time bedtime rolls around, I’ll probably be close to empty.So now I’m sitting in that space:  Am I gently pushing myself, or am I abandoning myself again?I don’t think I’m pushing from guilt exactly.But I’m aware that duty can become performance if I don’t check in with myself.And I am checking in.That’s why this feels different than it used to.I also think the shift came from being more honest with him.Telling him what annoys me.What he can do to make things smoother.Not in a punishing way—just being real, direct, human.And to my surprise, it worked.Things felt easier.He responded to my honesty with more calm, more respect.It’s amazing how children will often rise to meet our truth when we stop hiding it from them.I’m also giving myself credit for asking for help.Sunday’s ask was a sign of growth.His mum stepped up, not out of obligation, but out of shared care.There was no game-playing. Just honesty.And she respected that.That felt new.And needed.So yes, I’m tired.Yes, I might be driving more on duty than desire right now.But I also know I’ll return to myself.Wednesday I’ll see friends at college.Thursday I’ll support him at training.Friday and Saturday I rest.And Sunday is Father’s Day—a day that, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel okay about receiving.So this is what I’m learning:  Duty doesn’t have to mean self-abandonment.  Sacrifice isn’t always harmful, if you return to yourself after.  Sometimes parenting is showing up on half a tank—with truth instead of resentment.This is a gentle duty.And I’m learning how to walk it, without losing myself."

Dismissed.Disrespected—on behalf of the stranger, and maybe on behalf of myself.At first glance, it might seem small.But it touched something deeper:  A lifetime of having to be aware when others aren’t.I’ve always been the one who notices.Who adjusts.Who considers other people’s space, tone, feelings, limits.So when someone doesn’t even apologise for a blatant intrusion, it stings.Not because I need perfection—But because I’ve spent so much of my life carrying awareness for others who didn’t carry it themselves.And maybe there’s another layer.Maybe part of me feels a little envious of his ease—his ability to walk through the world without that kind of weight.There’s a part of me that wonders:  “What would it be like to not worry about everyone else for once?”But the truth is, I value that I notice.I like that I’m respectful of others.It’s part of who I am. It’s something I want to model for my son, for the people around me.It just gets heavy sometimes.Especially when it feels like no one else is carrying it with me.So maybe the annoyance wasn’t just about the dog.Maybe it was the quiet voice in me saying:  “I’m tired. I carry a lot. And I wish more people would meet me halfway.”That doesn’t mean I stop caring.But it does mean I get to have compassion for the part of me that’s been over-functioning for far too long.And maybe, when it makes sense, I can put the weight down for a bit.Even awareness needs rest."

And honestly, he probably already knows it — in the way I look at him, hold him, laugh with him. I think that’s enough. I know that’s enough.So I don’t need to frantically create or archive. I can rest.Because I’ve just let go of the last thread tying me to people who no longer belong in my life. One by one, I’ve said goodbye to relationships that drained me, that kept me tethered to a past self I’ve outgrown. It wasn’t with bitterness — it was with love for who I’ve become.My mother was the hardest. The oldest. The deepest root. Letting go of her — and everyone else after — has left me with a space I never thought I’d inhabit:Peace.Not the surface kind. The deep kind.The kind that says: I’m proud of myself. And I trust myself. Fully.Maybe for the first time.I’m not afraid to be alone anymore. In fact, I’ve found a kind of quiet thrill in it.But I’m also open — more open than I’ve ever been — to a relationship. Not to fill a gap, not to be rescued, but to walk beside someone. To share. To reflect love, not extract it.Yes, I’ll still project sometimes. But I’ll see it.Yes, I’ll still feel the need for touch. But I won’t abandon myself to chase it.Yes, I’ll still meet people who can’t meet me — but I won’t bend into who I’m not to keep them.I’ve arrived at a balance I didn’t know was possible:Grace for others, without the cost of myself.And now, I’m curious.Not desperate. Not performing.Just… curious about who might enter my life now that I’ve made space.This isn’t a high. It’s a horizon.A realignment.Altair — the soaring one. The bridge between constellations. The star that holds its place in the sky no matter who’s watching.That’s where I am now.And I’m not looking back."

I know that.I know my mother has no real power over me now.Even if she took the money — I’d survive. I’d rebuild.If anything, it would give me the final clarity to walk away for good — no emotional strings, no guilt, no performance of care when she dies.  And maybe, in a weird way, that’s what protects me now.She knows it too.She knows if she pulls that card, it’s game over.I didn’t manipulate that outcome. I just learned the rules.I’ve been playing this survival game since childhood — quietly, intuitively, unconsciously.And now? I’m no longer willing to play.But here’s the thing I’m finally naming:  The fear doesn’t come from the present.It comes from the child in me who still thinks that being seen means being punished.That child learned that truth is dangerous.That honesty causes withdrawal.That speaking your mind, even gently, can rip the fragile fabric of what little family you had.I saw it in my uncle’s eyes when I had an opinion he didn’t like.I saw it in the emotional freeze-out that followed.I saw it every time I dared to not be who they wanted me to be.So now, as an adult, I remind myself gently:  I’m safe.I’m allowed to speak.I’m allowed to share my story — even if it offends the ones who wrote me out of theirs.And if that scares them?That’s not my fault.That’s their legacy — not mine.I’m not protecting them anymore.I’m not shielding their image.And I’m certainly not going to carry the burden of their discomfort when they read my truth.This isn’t rebellion.This is reclamation.And whatever fear still lingers — it doesn’t get to drive the car anymore."

Gently. Honestly. Accountably.🌱 The Gift of VisibilityWhen I share something publicly, it becomes clearer to me.  If it sits well, I know it’s true.  If it doesn’t, I’ve just been handed a mirror.Not to shame myself — but to say:  “This part of me is asking for something deeper. Can I give it that — in a way that honours who I’m becoming?”💬 The People Who Matter…Not everyone will understand.Some will judge.Some will miss the nuance and the humanity.But those aren’t the people I’m building with.Those aren’t the ones I’m becoming emotionally available for.  “The people who matter won’t mind.And the people who mind don’t matter.”I’m not here to be perfect.I’m here to be real.And if my truth makes me flinch —Then maybe that’s the exact reason it needs to be seen."

      "content": "We talk a lot about “healing” — but real healing doesn’t always look like calm, light, or freedom.Sometimes it looks like confusion. Like grieving parts of yourself you used to perform.Sometimes it looks like feeling two things at once — and finally knowing you don’t have to pick one.That’s integration.🌱 What Is Integration?Integration is when the pieces of you that were once separate — the hurt child, the protective teenager, the exhausted adult — start sitting at the same table.It’s when you stop trying to erase parts of yourself and instead ask, “What did this part of me need?”It’s the opposite of perfection.It’s wholeness — even if it’s messy.🔄 What Integration Feels Like  Being triggered — and not shaming yourself for it  Remembering your past — and not drowning in it  Holding grief and gratitude in the same breath  Feeling sadness — but not being afraid of it anymore  Saying no — and not explaining whyIt’s subtle, but you feel it.A deep exhale. A return to self. A knowing that you don’t need to perform peace to be okay.🛤 The Stages of IntegrationThis isn’t linear — but here’s how it often unfolds:1. RecognitionYou realise there’s a pattern.A pain. A part of you that’s been living in the dark.You say: “Something doesn’t feel right anymore.”2. Compassionate WitnessingInstead of fixing or fighting it, you start listening.You begin to validate your own experience, not just with your mind — but with your heart.You say: “No wonder I feel this way.”3. Reclaiming the Exiled PartsYou stop rejecting the angry you.The ashamed you.The needy you.You say: “Come home. I’ve got you now.”4. Embodied UnderstandingYou don’t just know what happened — you feel its impact.But now, you also feel your capacity. You don’t just survive — you respond.You say: “This is still hard. But I’m not alone in it anymore.”5. Living AlignedYou make choices that reflect your whole self — not just the parts that people liked or rewarded.You start showing up as someone who knows who they are — and who they’re not.You say: “This is me. All of me. And I belong here.”💬 Integration Isn’t a DestinationYou don’t arrive at some healed version of yourself and stay there.You integrate, you unravel, you integrate again.But each time, it gets easier.You return to yourself faster.You believe your own"

And I am more than capable of protecting myself.💬 If they try to guilt me?I’ve outgrown those tactics.Their disapproval has no hold over my identity anymore.💸 If my mum tries to take the money?I’ll rebuild. I’ve already started.And if that’s the price I pay to never speak to her again, it’s a good trade.What I’m realising is:  There is no move they can make that undoes the peace I’ve found.Emotionally, I’ve cultivated something no one in my family ever gave me — a healthy, independent mindset.One that sees manipulation for what it is.One that doesn’t run from confrontation, but doesn’t chase it either.One that says: “Take what you want. I still keep me.”So what if I just showed them?Maybe it would free me from the waiting.Maybe it would trigger them, or silence them, or shock them.But none of that matters now — because I’m not doing it for them.I’m doing it because I’ve stopped hiding.And if they want to respond with money games, guilt, threats, or tantrums?  Let them.That’ll be their legacy.And this — this will be mine.💬 And if — one day — they do the work?If any one of them chooses to genuinely reflect,To apologise without strings,To take responsibility without deflecting it back onto me —Then yes, I’m open to connection.Not because I need it.Not because I’m waiting.But because I still believe in healing — when it’s real.But until then?I walk forward.Without guilt.

Some of it is inward.Not all healing is loud. Some of it is silent and sacred.Not all revolutions are external. Some happen quietly, in the dark, where no one sees — but everything changes.✨ What Comes NextThis series will hold the small, the slow, the sacred.Posts about shame, nervous system regulation, self-mothering, softening, and finding safety in stillness.If you’re tired of rushing, fixing, and forcing — welcome.This is your invitation to slow down, too.You don’t need to shout to change your life.Sometimes, all it takes is a whisper:  “I’m allowed to rest.”"

Hear you. Hold you.And so maybe—just maybe—he’s watching.Watching me choose self-respect over guilt.Watching me protect peace over performance.Watching me stand up and say:“This ends with me.”I don’t know what his mother will do with that.But I know what I’ve done.And that, I hope, is the lesson he carries forward:That you get to choose who stays in your life.That people must earn the right to stay.And that loving yourself sometimes means letting go of the ones who couldn’t love you right.Not in revenge.Not in hate.But in truth.For him.For me.For the child in me who needed someone to finally say, enough."

Or punish me. Or crumble.So I kept myself small.Played when I was unregulated.Burned through money.Told myself stories that kept me tethered to her emotional world.It wasn’t protection.It was control.She may have believed she was keeping me safe —But really, she just didn’t want to be left.🎯 The Truth About My SkillIt still feels arrogant to say it — but I need to.  I’m good. Really good.Not perfect. Not immune to downswings.But my win rate this year has been insane.Even with imperfections.Even with moments of dysregulation.It’s clear that when I am in balance, I can beat some of the best.And every day, I’m getting better.Not just as a player — but as a person.More grounded. More focused. More whole.🔓 Letting Go of the ContractI see now that the real block wasn’t technical.It wasn’t variance.It wasn’t strategy.It was this deep, unconscious contract I made as a child:  “If I stay small, maybe she’ll love me.”But I don’t want to stay small anymore.I don’t want to dim so someone else can feel safe.I don’t want to ruin my future to preserve a past that never held me properly.🌱 What Happens NextI’m not chasing greatness out of ego.I’m walking toward it because it’s mine.Because I’ve earned this clarity.Because I’ve survived what was meant to break me.Because I’m finally ready to win — for me.And if that means leaving behind the systems that kept me stuck?Then so be it."

I no longer ask for permission to be myself.And that’s powerful.Still, I feel a flicker of guilt — but it’s not real.It’s not mine.It’s just the echo of old stories that said love means always being available.🤍 This Isn’t Rejection — It’s AlignmentOne of the people I’ve drifted from isn’t a bad person.He’s kind. Loyal, in his way.But from what he shares, most of his relationships have crumbled because he isn’t emotionally available.That tells me something important:  I’m not alone in feeling unmet.So rather than chasing connection where there’s no real depth, I’m choosing something different now.Reciprocity. Mutuality. Presence.If I want to become more emotionally available — to my son, to a partner, to myself — then I need to invest in relationships where that kind of presence lives and breathes.🕊️ Letting Go Isn’t CruelIt’s not hate.It’s not bitterness.It’s not even sadness, really.It’s just a quiet, graceful letting go.  “You can’t meet me where I am — and that’s okay.I still wish you well, from over here.”This isn’t a dramatic exit.It’s a soft door closing — not locked, but no longer open out of habit.🌿 Part of The Quiet RevolutionThis moment is part of a bigger pattern:The more I come home to myself, the less I tolerate being half-held.And not because I’m cold — but because I’m finally warm within.I don’t need to explain myself anymore.I don’t need to perform connection.I get to choose peace.And if that means walking away from good people who can’t meet me —Then I’ll walk gently, with self-respect in every step."

It’s rejection.Not performing warmth to fragile people? It’s a crime.And I’m seeing now — it was always like that.My uncle gave me cards once a year. He was present in fragments. But I think I clung to those fragments not because they were love — but because they were something. And when you grow up with so little, you mistake crumbs for a meal. You start convincing yourself that emotional coldness is just another version of affection.But now, as an adult, I see it more clearly:That wasn’t love.That wasn’t safety.That wasn’t family.  It was survival dressed up in politeness.It was performance dressed up as connection.I think he was shaped by the same brokenness that shaped my mum. I think he, too, didn’t get much love.

He’s not demanding.  The pressure comes from me — from a performative script I didn’t choose.→ I don’t need to earn being a good dad. I already am.4. Let Him Be Free, Let Me Breathe  He plays online.  I take time for myself in the back room.→ I’m not abandoning him. I’m resourcing myself.🌿 A Thought to Hold  “Presence doesn’t mean performance.It means being real,And staying with myselfWhile I stay with him.”If I forget this rhythm, I can return to it.If I lose myself for a moment, I can begin again.He doesn’t need a perfect dad — just a real one.And tonight, I remembered how to be both."

Was I wrong to believe I mattered?  How could someone love me and still leave me so wounded?🧠 Why It Still Feels DirtyBecause it was a violation — not of my body, but of my emotional innocence.I trusted what I felt.And his actions contradicted it so strongly that I started to mistrust myself.  It wasn’t just a lack of love.It was love that came dressed in rejection.And I’ve been trying to make sense of that ever since.⚖️ Maybe He Loved Me. But He Still Failed Me.These truths can live side by side:  He may have loved me in a deeply broken way.  He still left me emotionally shattered.That doesn’t mean I have to hate him.But it also doesn’t mean I have to keep explaining his choices as some noble sacrifice.Because the truth is — I could have died.And love that pushes a child to the edge of suicide is not love that worked.🪞 The Roots of Low Self-EsteemIt makes so much sense now.Why I’ve struggled to trust love.Why I doubt my instincts.Why my self-esteem has always felt fragile — like it was built on borrowed scaffolding.If the people who were meant to hold you don’t —you learn to abandon yourself before anyone else gets the chance.🩹 When Healing Isn’t ResolutionThis isn’t a post with a clean ending.There’s no bow to tie here.Just a deep breath and a small truth:  The wound may not be ready to close.But I am ready to sit with it — without shame.Without rushing.Without abandoning the boy in me who still needs to be held.🕯 A Quiet PromiseTo that boy:You weren’t wrong.You weren’t crazy.You felt love — and you were right to trust that.It wasn’t your job to translate cruelty into care.And I won’t leave you behind again.Even if the wound stays open, I’ll stay too.That’s the love you deserved.And now — it’s the love you’ll get."

Not the performance. Not the future we were supposed to walk into.I wanted someone who could hold me.Emotionally.Intimately.Humanly.And the more I wanted that, the more I realised:  She couldn’t.Not because she was cruel.But because she wasn’t emotionally available in the way I needed.She didn’t ask.She didn’t see.She didn’t meet me.And I think, deep down, I had always felt that.🧠 Did I Push Her Away?That question haunted me for a long time.But now I think the truth is this:  I didn’t push her away. I just stopped playing along.Stopped pretending the connection was deep when it was mostly imagined.Stopped carrying the fantasy.Stopped waiting for intimacy to arrive where it had never really been planted.And when I stopped pretending, the distance revealed itself.🩹 The Sadness That LingersWe had a child.We built a life.We shared years.And still, I never felt truly known.Not past the surface.Not past the story.That’s the sadness that lingers — not just what was lost, but what was never really found.🕯 What I Know NowWhat we had was a fantasy — one we both created to escape old pain.But fantasies can’t hold real people.And the more real I became, the more the illusion collapsed.I don’t regret the time.But I grieve what we tried to make out of loneliness and longing.And I honour the part of me that stopped pretending —even when it cost me the story I thought I wanted."

And when those are the messages you grow up with, you don’t stop loving your parent —you stop trusting yourself.❓ Did I Make It Up?That’s what lingers.Even now, even as an adult, part of me wonders:Was I wrong? Did I project love onto someone who couldn’t give it? Was I a fool for believing I mattered to him at all?And that part of me — the part that second-guesses everything — is the wound he left behind.He may have loved me.Maybe he even thought he was helping me by pushing me away.But none of that undoes the deep confusion he planted inside me.🧠 The Cost of That Kind of LoveWhen someone tells you one thing with their presence and another with their actions, it shatters your inner compass.Especially when you’re young.You stop asking: Is this love?And start asking: What’s wrong with me that it hurts so much?You start performing.People-pleasing.Overthinking.You doubt your gut because it once led you straight into heartbreak.🧩 Trying to Make Sense of ItI’ve spent years trying to understand it.Maybe he couldn’t love me softly because he was never loved that way himself.Maybe he pushed me away because he believed I wouldn’t survive if I stayed.Maybe he thought I wouldn’t understand, so he made himself the villain.But even if all that’s true —it still hurt.It still left me carrying a question I couldn’t answer for decades:If someone loved me, why did it feel like abandonment?🛠 Rebuilding Self-TrustThis is the work now:  To feel the love that was there without denying the pain it caused.  To recognize that my instincts weren’t wrong — the expression of love was.  To start trusting that what I feel is real, even if someone else couldn’t honour it.The goal isn’t to rewrite the past.It’s to reclaim my inner compass — to believe myself again.💬 Final ThoughtIf you grew up being loved in a way that made you question yourself — you are not alone.And you’re not broken.Sometimes love comes through broken people with broken tools.It doesn’t mean you weren’t worthy of being held with care.It just means they didn’t know how.But you can learn how now.You can be the one who listens to yourself, trusts your gut, and heals the gap between what you knew and what you were told.That kind of love — the one that rebuilds self-trust — starts with you."

Or maybe something quieter than that — clarity.🧠 The Inner Child Needed to BelieveFor most of my life, a younger part of me had to believe he loved me.Because the alternative — that he pushed me away, rejected me, or simply didn’t know how to be with me — was too painful to face.So I protected him in my mind.I made his silence into strategy.His absence into sacrifice.His coldness into care.That story helped me survive.But it didn’t help me heal.🪨 Now I See It DifferentlyNow, I can say:  Even if he believed he loved me, I don’t agree with how he showed it.And I don’t have to carry the burden of trying to make it enough.I get to decide what love is for me now.I get to say:  Love isn’t silence.  Love isn’t abandonment.  Love isn’t something that leaves a hole in your chest and calls it protection.🧭 Love That Isn’t Felt Isn’t Love That HealsMaybe he loved me.But if that love didn’t hold me, protect me, nurture me, or make me feel safe —Then it wasn’t the kind of love I needed.It might’ve been love in his mind.But it didn’t land.It didn’t reach.And it didn’t raise me.And that’s not bitterness.That’s truth.💬 I’m Not Angry Anymore. Just Clear.He doesn’t get to define what love means for me anymore.He doesn’t get to have the final word — because he’s gone.And because I’m no longer the child hoping he’ll come back in some better form.  I’m the one who defines love now.And I want a kind of love that shows up.That holds.That stays.That doesn’t confuse or control or vanish.And if what he gave me doesn’t meet that standard?I’m allowed to let it go.🕯 What RemainsI honour the boy who wanted so badly to be loved.I honour the man I’ve become who now sees clearly why that love was never enough.And I walk forward with the kind of love I needed back then —the kind I now know how to give to myself.Soft.

Not fully. But I felt it.And when I looked at my dad, I could see he did too.This song is chaos and power and soul. It’s defiance. It’s freedom. It’s walking into a storm and deciding you’re not afraid anymore.Now, years later, I wonder if it was more than just a cool guitar riff.Maybe it was about becoming someone who can leave.Someone who won’t be controlled.Someone who knows how much energy it takes to stand up and say, enough.When Hendrix sang about chopping down a mountain or standing next to a fire and making it rain — I think he was talking about spiritual power. Not ego. But the kind of power you find when you reclaim yourself.That’s what it felt like for me, especially as I got older.Especially as I saw some of the emotional dynamics in my family more clearly.Especially with my mum.It’s strange. My dad and I didn’t always have the words.But when this song came on, we didn’t need them.There was something mutual in that moment.Maybe a shared ache.Maybe a shared pride in seeing the fire in each other’s eyes.It’s the song that made me fall in love with guitar.Because it wasn’t just music — it was expression.It said things I didn’t know how to say.It screamed when I couldn’t.I’m still learning how to walk away from things that don’t serve me.Still learning how to channel the power, not suppress it.But every time I hear that song, I remember that I can.And I remember the look on my dad’s face the first time he saw me really play.As if to say: You’ve got it too.“I didn’t mean to take up all your sweet time… I’ll give it right back one of these days.”Maybe not today.But one of these days — I’ll play this song for my son.And I’ll mean every note.

I’m starting to choose peace over hypervigilance.Presence over performance.I don’t need to stay wired in just to feel safe.I can check once a day.I can wait until my body feels ready.And that’s not avoidance. That’s trust — in myself, in the people who are there, and in the pace that keeps me well.Stress Doesn’t Equal SafetyYesterday, my stress levels were through the roof.All day. Through the night.Even though nothing overtly dangerous happened — it was just my nervous system working overtime.It reminded me that just because something is good for me in theory, it doesn’t mean I’m ready to be immersed in it fully.Even safe connection can feel intense when I’ve lived a life that taught me to be cautious with closeness.Tiny Teaspoons of TrustThat’s what I’m doing.Not pouring the whole bottle of vulnerability at once.Not rushing toward some perfect version of community.Just offering myself tiny teaspoons of trust.One reply. One check-in. One message. One silence.And when it feels right — another.It’s All Coming Together in Its Own WayMaybe it’s not about fixing the whole system.Maybe it’s just about slowing down enough to let it rewire safely.I don’t need to force connection.I don’t need to rush safety.I don’t need to prove anything.  I just need to keep choosing myself — gently, daily — and let the rest come when it’s ready.And maybe that’s what healing really is:Not an explosion.

That grief, strangely, has settled.But my dad… he’s harder.Because I felt something in him.A gentleness he couldn’t quite show.A love that got buried beneath coldness.And something in me has always believed — he pushed me away on purpose.Not to hurt me.But to save me.🔄 The Paradox That’s Hard to HoldHe treated me with disdain. Made home unbearable.And yet, part of me believes he did that to force me to leave.Because leaving was the only way I’d be safe.The only way I’d get a real chance.That kind of love — if that’s what it was — is hard to receive.Harder still to forgive.It wasn’t fair.It hurt.But maybe, in his own broken way, it was mercy.🧩 Sorting Through the Emotional DebrisI don’t want to keep revisiting this to punish myself or romanticize him.I just want to understand the scraps — to clear them from my nervous system so they don’t haunt future relationships.Because being pushed away — even with good intentions — still leaves a scar.It plants a seed of doubt: Am I loveable up close?

As you were.I think I would have understood you more.And maybe you would have seen I turned out okay.  I don’t know if you pushed me away to save me.But if you did — thank you.  Still, I carry the ache of being sent away without explanation.And I wish we’d found another way.  I forgive you — not because it didn’t hurt,but because holding it forever will only deepen the wound.  You gave me life. Now I’m learning how to live it.On my terms.With softness.With love.Some days, I still feel the weight of what could’ve been.But I also feel the strength of what I’ve made from it.And maybe that’s the strange mercy after all."

Of grieving? Of remembering something he never fully named?💔 Adele – Someone Like YouA song of grief disguised as strength.  “Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you…”It would play quietly in the background—on drives, in the kitchen, through thin walls at night.A love song, yes—but also a lament. A goodbye that never settled. A wound still slightly open.I think he felt this.Not just for someone else—but for the man he might’ve been.  ⏳ Coldplay – ClocksA song of time slipping away.  “Am I part of the cure, or am I part of the disease?”The piano never stopped. That circular riff—it felt like time looping. Like regret on repeat.He didn’t say much, but I could feel the friction in him.Like he was living life from a distance.This song sounded like what it felt like to be around him. Present, but unreachable.  🕯 Evanescence – Bring Me to LifeA song of emotional shutdown and the longing to be revived.  “Wake me up inside… Save me from the nothing I’ve become.”This one scared me a little.Not because of the music—but because it felt too real.Who was he playing this for? Himself? My mum? God? No one?Maybe a part of him was numb. And this song was trying to cut through the ice.  🧠 What These Songs ShareIt’s not genre.It’s emotional paralysis.It’s longing. Regret. Sleepwalking. A quiet plea for something real.These songs are about:  Wanting to be woken up  Mourning a life that passed unspoken  Feeling stuck in your own mind  Wishing someone could pull you outHe never said those things out loud.But maybe, through these songs, he did.✍️ What That Left In MeI grew up with the ache of those songs all around me.Not loud. But always present. Like emotional wallpaper.And maybe that’s why I feel things so deeply.Why I don’t want to numb.Why I write.Because even if he never found a way to say it—I will.

He knew that the only way I could grow was away from the house. He encouraged friendships. He supported them.

Out toward life.“Go escape this,” he seemed to say.“Go out. You’ll be okay.”And when I was 14, 15, wandering around London, getting mugged now and then, my dad didn’t clamp down. He didn’t panic. He said, “He’ll figure it out.”He trusted me. He believed in me. He knew my mates were good people. And he quietly supported that.One memory sticks out more than most:He used to buy cheap donuts—13p a pack—and drop them off at my friends’ houses. Sometimes to the parents, sometimes to the mates themselves. No big gesture. Just a quiet “thank you” for being in my life.I used to think it was weird. And maybe it was weird. But it was also beautiful.Because that’s how he loved.Not loudly. Not conventionally.But in donuts. In open doors. In awkward silences.In freedom. In trust.In pushing me toward a better life, even when he knew it meant letting go.I don’t think I ever said it clearly when he was alive. But I see it now.He protected me in ways no one else ever did.And I carry those quiet gifts with me."

      "content": "I notice a quiet anxiety bubbling up.Something about the pace —The speed at which I’ve been sharing so much of myself online.I look at the post dates,I see the flood of thoughts and feelingsfinally landing in public view.And I wonder:Is it too much? Am I exposing too much, too fast?But the truth is — this isn’t new.These aren’t fleeting whims or unfiltered confessions.These are the same parts of meI’ve circled back to for years.And I’ve finally given them a home.A place to land, to breathe, to be known — even if just by me.This Is Not the Same As BeforeYes, I’ve felt this before.The last time I felt this flood of insight and griefwas when everything shattered and I spiraled into psychosis.But this is different.This time, I’m not alone.I’m not suffocating it with weed.I’m not living in fear or shame of what I’m discovering.I’m being held — by friends, by a community, even by myself.And I feel safe enough to explore the depth of these truthswithout needing to abandon myself to survive them.What Happened at 23I was twenty-three when the weight of it hit.The realization that neither of my parents— nor anyone in my family —ever truly loved or held me in the way I needed.And that realization…It broke me.It fractured everything I thought I knew.The loneliness was too much to bear.I didn’t know it then, but what came after — the psychosis —probably saved my life.It was the mind’s way of shielding me from the full blastof a truth I wasn’t ready to fully absorb.And I hold nothing but empathy for that version of me —that younger self who did what he could to stay afloat.The Survivor In MeThere’s a part of me that’s always shown up in the darkest moments.The one that says,“Enough. I’m standing firm. You can all fk off.”**That voice, that fire —it’s what saved me.It got punished.Silenced.Beaten emotionally, physically, spiritually.My mum hated it.My dad resented it.But it survived.And more than that:It protected me.Time and time again.I’m Not Just Trying to Be Myself AnymoreI’m not performing authenticity.I’m living it.Letting the blocks fall. Letting the truth rise.It’s not that I’ve become something better.It’s that I’ve let myself be seen —by me.And the part that protected me?I see him now.And I thank him.Because without him, I wouldn’t be here.Nothing Can Stop Me Now"

I’m proud of you. I’ve got you.”And meant it.🩹 Why I’m Naming This NowBecause for too long, I tried to make their version of love enough.Tried to explain it. Understand it. Excuse it.But the truth is — it wasn’t enough.And no amount of inner work will make it retroactively nurturing.Naming the love I deserved doesn’t mean I’m stuck.It means I’m finally facing forward.🕯 And for My Inner ChildYou were never too much.You were never unworthy.You didn’t ask for anything unreasonable.You asked for love — and got confusion.You asked for care — and got distance.But I see you now.And I will not let you go unseen ever again.This is the love I deserved.And this is the love I’m learning to give — to myself, to my child, to the future.One clear truth at a time."

      "content": "Some albums aren’t just music.They become mythology—especially when you play them on loop while driving across America, beside the woman you love, with the windows down and the future still unwritten.For my dad, that album was U2’s The Joshua Tree.He didn’t just like it.He played it repeatedly while driving with my mum across the States—young, in love, maybe even a little idealistic.And I don’t think it was just about the music.I think it was about who he got to be while it played.🌄 A Soundtrack of Hope, Before It All Fell ApartThis was a time before the silence, the shutdown, the complicated layers of family life.When love still felt like freedom, not a trap.When the horizon still felt open.And when he put The Joshua Tree on repeat, maybe he wasn’t trying to relive the music.Maybe he was trying to relive himself—that younger version, still full of promise, still unburdened by disappointment.🙏 A Man Searching for Meaning  “I still haven’t found what I’m looking for…”That lyric isn’t about aimless longing.It’s about spiritual hunger.The whole album breathes with that ache.It’s soulful, searching, soaked in both beauty and brokenness.And maybe that’s why it landed so deeply with my dad—because he was a man who felt deeply, but never quite knew what to do with that feeling.The music gave his ache a place to live.It didn’t fix anything. But it gave him language, even if only in private.🚗 Why the Driving MatteredThere’s something symbolic about the fact that he played it while moving.Driving.Crossing a vast landscape.Beside the woman who would later become part of both his passion and his pain.That movement might have felt like therapy.Or escape.Or maybe the closest he ever got to feeling truly free.  The open road was the church.The music was the sermon.The car was the confessional.And in that moving moment, he wasn’t a husband under pressure.He wasn’t a man who’d one day grow silent.He was just a person—searching, alive, and temporarily unburdened.🧠 What That Album Says About Him  He was longing for something greater  He carried depth he couldn’t always express  He felt more alive when the world was wide, not small  He never really stopped searching, even when life asked him to settle🪞 What That Leaves in MeI grew up with echoes of that music.Not just in sound—but in spirit.And I think a part of me inherited that ache.That drive to find something real.That craving for freedom and meaning, even when the road ahead feels foggy.  I don’t just want to repeat his mistakes.I want to understand his longing,so I can walk my own road—with the windows down, but my eyes wide open.🎶 Listen to the Full Album  He may never have said these things aloud.But he played them.And maybe—just maybe—that was his way of telling me everything."

      "content": "My uncle Mark told me I shouldn’t be crying at my dad’s funeral.That moment has never left me. It didn’t just sting—it confirmed something I’d always felt: he never saw me. Never cared. He made fun of me growing up. And maybe—just maybe—that was his way of projecting his hatred for my mother onto me. Maybe she hurt him, or belittled him, and I became the extension of her he could punish.I never saw any warmth from him. His wife, my auntie, did show me something that resembled care. It was rare, but when it came, it landed. And that’s what made it harder. She showed me what attention could feel like. But it was so inconsistent. Visits once every couple of years. No real effort to reach out. When they visited my mum, they didn’t invite me. Not really a relationship—just echoes of what might’ve been.I feel a deep sadness that Mark, like others, seems to have bought into my mother’s perception of me. Like there was a shared narrative about who I was, and none of them ever asked me if it was true.And honestly, I don’t want to be close to him. I saw him recently, and the rage I felt was raw. Fuck you, you fucking prick. That’s what rose up. He was sick, and I wasn’t sad. If anything, I think I let it show. It’s convoluted. It’s not easy to admit. But it’s real.Still, we played football—me, my son, my uncle, and my cousins. For that moment, something felt beautiful. That’s why I went. I wanted to show my son that he has extended family. But maybe that wasn’t the lesson. Maybe the real lesson was: you don’t need to chase connection that never chased you.Then there’s my other uncle, Martin.He’s a bit of a mystery. I don’t know if he got on with my dad. I don’t know if he wants a connection with me. He says things like, “You could come up to Scotland,” but it doesn’t feel warm. It doesn’t feel like wanting—it feels like obligation. But maybe that’s all he knows how to offer.And yet… he gave me games growing up. He sent me a birthday card every single year. That consistency meant something. He didn’t have kids—said he felt like an extra child in a family that had already finished parenting. He was the afterthought. Maybe that’s why he doesn’t give more. Maybe no one ever gave much to him.What I’m learning is this:Some people don’t want to connect. Others don’t know how.Some only give what they’ve got, and it’s not much.And I don’t have to keep bleeding for scraps. I don’t have to chase approval or soften myself just to be accepted.The family that wasn’t there? I don’t need to carry their absence as my fault.I’m here now. For myself. For my son. And for the version of me that’s no longer waiting to be chosen."

In fact, I don’t think I could have. So I just want to say… I appreciate it.You were quirky. Eccentric. Funny. Joyful. You turned ordinary things into weird little adventures. You had this dry, dark humour that lit up even the worst moments. If we were ever in the trenches together, I think we’d be laughing about it between shell blasts. And yeah, you were emotionally immature in some ways—but you were present. You were real. And that’s more than I can say for a lot of people.You showed up the only way you knew how: by trying to give me more than you had. Putting me in a posh school, trying to make my life easier, even if it meant feeling out of place yourself. I see now that everything you did came from a deep intention to help me, even if it felt confusing at the time. And that intention—to care, to love, to give—was so strong in you.You gave me things I didn’t fully appreciate until now.A sense of humour that helps me survive.A quiet dignity.A value for integrity—even when it’s hard.And most of all, a deep, strange, sincere love for dogs.When I play with dogs, I feel most like you.It’s not about commands or control. It’s just presence. Joy. The kind of connection where nothing needs to be said. That was you. That’s me.My first therapist, John, once suggested something that’s always stuck with me.He said maybe you got the dogs to replace me after I left home.At the time I didn’t want to believe that. But now, I see it differently.You took in a rescue dog—a wild one. A dog that had been mistreated, the kind that might’ve been put down. You didn’t try to train him. You just let him be. Let him be crazy. Let him be exactly who he was. Even when it put you at risk. Even when he pulled you over in the street.You used to play with that dog. Not just care for him—but wind him up, laugh at his chaos, stir his madness on purpose. You loved it. You lit up. You were free. It was the happiest I ever saw you.And maybe that says it all.You found joy in the chaos. You didn’t try to tame what was wild. You let things be strange and unpredictable and honest. Because maybe you knew that love doesn’t have to look neat to be real.That dog wasn’t a replacement for me. It was an extension of what you couldn’t fully express. And maybe, in winding him up, you were loving a part of both of us.I never got to grieve you properly. The system I was in didn’t honour you. They didn’t see your goodness. They painted you in strange colours I didn’t recognise. And so I learned not to feel the grief. Not to feel the love.But I do now.And I carry you in the best parts of me.When I laugh at the darkness.When I play with dogs.When I choose love, even if it’s complicated.You did well, mate.And I miss you."

And I’ve always known, underneath, it was about something else. Something older. Something quieter.And now I think I understand it.When I was in primary school, my best friend was Japanese. And his mother—she looked after me in a way I didn’t know I needed. She covered me, loved me, offered a kind of warmth and emotional generosity that I wasn’t getting at home. And even though I couldn’t name it back then, my body knew.It felt safe. It felt held. It felt like love.And that kind of safety leaves a mark.It wasn’t about culture in any intellectual way. As a child, I didn’t know the difference between Thai and Japanese cultures. I just felt love from someone who looked a little different than me. Someone who moved through the world gently. Who welcomed me. Who held space for me without trying to change me.That’s what I think my body remembers.That’s what I think I still search for—sometimes without knowing it.Not a type. Not a fantasy.But a feeling.A memory of being loved. When I needed it most.The mind can forget. The logic can tell you what “makes sense.” But the nervous system remembers.And often, what we’re drawn to—who we’re drawn to—has less to do with desire, and more to do with safety.With care.With connection.With a moment in childhood where something finally felt okay.That’s what this is.It’s not complicated.It’s not shameful.It’s just the body remembering care.

      "content": "I’ve been noticing something lately.A recent moment of respect or consideration from my ex — even if it was just about our son — stirred something deeper in me. Not longing. Not regret. Just… reflection.For a second, I found myself thinking:“Was it all my fault?”“Was there something healthy there that I just ruined?”That’s not my grounded self speaking. That’s the voice of the critical parent within me — the one that always assumes I’m the problem. The one that finds ways to blame me whenever things feel unclear.🪞 Projection and MisunderstandingI don’t think I saw her clearly — but I don’t think she saw me clearly either.She projected things onto me: that I was controlling, difficult, unsafe. And maybe, in moments, I did act in ways that reflected those labels. But they weren’t the whole truth.The projections shaped me. They pressed on insecurities that already lived in me.And the more I tried to prove I wasn’t those things, the more entangled I became.That’s how misunderstanding becomes a self-fulfilling loop.🧩 The Need to Understand the ScrapsI’m not trying to fix it.I’m not even trying to justify it.I’m just trying to understand the scraps — the fragments of what was, the emotional dust left behind — so I can build something more whole next time.Because I don’t want to bring confusion into the next connection.I don’t want to defend myself from ghosts.I don’t want to prove I’m good to someone who’s already chosen not to see it.🧱 A New FoundationSo I revisit the past — not to live in it — but to mine it for wisdom.What did I ignore?What did I mistake for love?What parts of me were never safe to show?The answers aren’t always clear. But they’re honest.And honesty — not perfection — is what I want to build the next relationship on.📝 A Note to My Future Self (and to My Son, if You Ever Read This)If you’re ever in a relationship again and start to feel like you have to prove your worth — pause.You don’t have to shrink, perform, or defend who you are.The right person will see you, not just project something onto you.They’ll want to understand, not just be right.They’ll meet you — not manage you.And if you’re reading this, son:Know that even when things didn’t work out between your parents, I kept learning.Not just for me. For you.So you’d grow up seeing that love doesn’t mean losing yourself.We can always begin again — but this time, from truth."

You notice when you’re overwhelmed — and you name it.  You speak to yourself with slightly more kindness than you used to.  You no longer try to fix or chase people who don’t meet you.  You walk away from things that once hooked you.  You feel grief and let it happen.  You don’t abandon yourself in the name of being liked.  You hold space for others without losing your own ground.  You catch yourself before spiraling — even if just once.  You choose rest instead of guilt-tripping yourself into productivity.  You allow joy without assuming it will disappear.  You cry. Not because you’re broken — but because you’re healing.  You feel the urge to numb… and sometimes, you don’t.  You no longer need to prove your worth in every room.  You stop and say, “I don’t know what I need, but I know I need something.”🕯 You’re Becoming Softer — Not WeakerHealing isn’t just becoming tougher.It’s becoming more honest.More gentle.More in tune with your needs.If you’ve felt tired lately, disconnected, or unsure — maybe you’re not doing anything wrong.Maybe you’re just in a part of the story where the roots grow deeper than the leaves.And that’s still growth.💬 Keep GoingThe version of you that doubted everything, chased unavailable love, and never rested — you’re already leaving them behind.Not perfectly.Not linearly.But steadily.One small marker at a time."

I misread spots. I make poor decisions.Not because I’m a bad player — but because I’m not really there.I’m trying to soothe a wound using variance.I’m trying to get clarity from chaos.And the losses hurt way more than they should.💸 How Much Has This Cost Me?If I’m honest, I’ve probably lost tens of thousands over the years just by playing when I was dysregulated.When I wasn’t grounded.When I used the game to carry pain I didn’t want to face.But in the long run, I haven’t lost. Not really.Because I’m learning.Learning that poker isn’t just a game — it’s a reflection of my internal state.And when I can’t hold myself, the game will hold a mirror up to that, too.🐛 The Empty RoomRight now, I feel like I’m in what my tutor once called “the cocoon stage.”But it doesn’t feel like a transformation.It feels like death.Not literal — but emotional.A kind of nothingness.Low energy.Disconnection.Lethargy.Like I’m shedding something I didn’t choose to lose.There’s a silence here that’s almost unbearable.Like I’m floating in an empty room with no light, no direction — just grief.🧭 And Yet, There’s Still a CompassThere’s a quiet part of me that knows:This is the work.This is the transformation.Not the flash. Not the breakthrough.But the in-between.The crumble before the clarity.🧠 So What Now?Here’s what I’m holding onto:  I don’t need to play when I’m dysregulated. The game will always be there. My centre won’t.  This isn’t forever. The cocoon isn’t a coffin. It’s a necessary pause before something real takes shape.  Small steps are sacred. Breathing. Resting. Not chasing. That’s progress — even if it doesn’t look like it.💬 Final ThoughtIf you’re here too — in your own version of the empty room — know this:You’re not broken.You’re not behind.You’re just in it.And in time, what feels like nothing will turn into something.Maybe not quickly.Maybe not obviously.But the seed is already planted.And you’re becoming someone who doesn’t just survive storms —but knows how to sit with them without losing who you are."

      "content": "There’s something quietly astonishing about how music moves through us.The same song can follow us for years — and yet we never hear it the same way twice. One verse might once have felt uplifting, and later ache with a truth we didn’t know we were carrying. Another line might drift by unnoticed until one day, it stops us cold.It’s not the music that’s changed.It’s us.🎵 A Mirror, Not a MessageMusic, in many ways, is a mirror.We project our longings, memories, wounds, and healing onto it — sometimes without even realizing it. It doesn’t tell us what to feel. It reveals what’s already there, quietly waiting to be heard.You can listen to the same song at twelve, twenty-five, and forty, and each time, it lands differently — because you are different. It’s like that Heraclitus quote:  “No man ever steps in the same river twice,for it’s not the same river, and he’s not the same man.”Music doesn’t just evoke memories. It helps make sense of them. It becomes a companion on the journey — not to distract us, but to reflect us.🎶 The Shifting Lens of MeaningThere’s a beauty in that.A break-up song isn’t always about another person.A victory anthem isn’t always about triumph.Sometimes, what we hear in a lyric is exactly what our soul is whispering — we just needed someone else to sing it aloud.And sometimes, we return to an old song and realize:“I never knew this was what it really meant… until now.”🪞 Music as Self-UnderstandingMusic connects us to ourselves not through logic, but through feeling.It bypasses the overthinking mind and goes straight to the heart.And it teaches us — again and again — that growth isn’t always loud or obvious.Sometimes, growth is just hearing the same song and finally understanding what it was always trying to show you.So the next time a song hits you differently, pause.Not because the music changed — but because you have.And that’s something worth listening to."

That fear wasn’t invented in adulthood.It came from childhood.From the moments where being my true self wasn’t just unsafe — it was punishable.But now, as an adult, I’m starting to see:She can’t take anything from me that truly matters.And if she did try? It would only reveal more of who she is — not who I am.It’s Already Helped One PersonMe.That alone is enough reason to keep going.But if even one other person — maybe someone on my course, someone in the group — reads something I’ve written and feels a little less alone?Then that’s even more reason.Because the people who are in the thick of survival?They don’t need poetic introspection.They need structure, safety, relief.But those who are ready to go deeper?They might need this kind of truth.The kind that doesn’t perform.The kind that simply is.I’m Not Trying to Be Authentic AnymoreI just am.It’s not some effortful performance of healing.It’s more like I’ve removed enough resistance to let what’s already inside flow through me.Not all of it. Not perfectly. But enough.Enough to feel free.Enough to feel safe.Enough to feel like I’m no longer betraying myself just to protect someone else’s version of reality.This Was the Path All AlongI think I’ve been building this site in my subconscious my whole life.Not for approval.Not for validation.But because it’s the one place where all parts of me can be held — witnessed — and maybe even loved.And I’ll never force it on anyone.Not my son.Not strangers.Not the people who couldn’t meet me.But it’s here now. And it’s mine.For the First Time, I’m AlignedMaybe not finished.Maybe not healed.But for the first time in my life, a path feels clear.It feels aligned with who I am, who I’ve become — and who I’m becoming.And even through this grief — in this very moment — I’m enjoying something rare:A moment of truth.A moment of safety.A moment of being me."

Not every day, but most days.  You will be met — in ways that make past versions of love feel paper-thin.  You will rest more often without guilt.  You will build a life that doesn’t demand your performance.  You will feel peace where the ache once sat.  You will trust yourself — gently, steadily, deeply.And not because you fixed everything.But because you finally stopped running from anything.What You’re Doing Right Now MattersEvery time you sit with the grief instead of numbing…Every time you walk away with self-respect instead of proving your worth…Every time you stay soft when your instincts want to harden…You’re shaping the ground I now stand on.You’re giving me roots.I Don’t Need You to Be PerfectI don’t need you to be healed tomorrow.I just need you to keep showing up — honestly.With your sadness.With your confusion.With your small glimmers of joy.That’s enough.That’s always been enough.With love from the future —still soft, still human,but no longer scared of her own reflection,You."

His parents didn’t speak much English, and mine didn’t speak Japanese—but the connection between our families was deep. Real. Loving. When they moved, they gave me an open invitation: they’d pay for everything. All I had to do was get myself there.So I got three paper rounds.Worked every day.Saved £600.And I flew across the world.What strikes me now is not just what I did—but why.That family made me feel deeply loved. Seen. Accepted. I wanted to see them again, not for adventure, but because they felt like home. And the only reason that relationship was even possible… was because of my dad.He cultivated that connection. Encouraged it. Nurtured it.Even with cultural barriers. Even when communication was hard.Because he recognised love when he saw it. And he made space for it.It’s a testament to the kind of man he was. The kind who didn’t need words to connect. The kind who valued sincerity over polish. The kind who loved quietly, but completely.I still have the books they made for me—full of photos, drawings, little mementos from my time there. I still remember the feeling of arriving at that airport and seeing them waiting for me. The safety. The warmth. The awe of being in Japan at that age.My mum and dad trusted me to go. They knew how good this family was. That speaks volumes.I haven’t spoken to them in ten years.Maybe because I felt abandoned when they left.Or maybe because I forgot that part of myself existed.But I’ve reached out to the old email addresses they gave me in 2015. All six or seven of them. I don’t know if any will still work—but I hope one does.Because now, I’d love to reconnect.Not just for me.But to bring my son.To show him a piece of the world that my father helped cultivate—a place of friendship, respect, and real human connection across difference.It wasn’t just a trip.It was love, in motion.And it all started with a paper round.                                            &#10094;  &#10095;                                      "

But I don’t think I’m isolating.I think I’m recharging.Processing grief.Letting go of illusions I used to cling to for safety.And when I do connect — whether it’s with someone I trust at college, or with a stranger I meet gently — I show up more honestly than ever before.That’s not fear.That’s growth.🪞 The Old Wounds Still Echo — But I’m Aware NowYes, I still project sometimes.Yes, I still get triggered by women in authority.Yes, I still have an inner child who looks for safety in old patterns.But I’m not running from that anymore.I’m not shaming it.I’m choosing people who can hold space for it — and I’m learning to hold it myself.🩹 I’m Not Second-Guessing Because I’m WeakMy second-guessing was cultivated — especially by my mother.She called it a weakness.But I see now it was a seed of self-doubt she planted to keep me small.I’m slowly unlearning that.I’m learning that I can trust my body. My gut. My truth.Even if I’m not always certain — I’m no longer abandoning myself to gain approval.🕯 I Want to Let Love InI’m not chasing it.I’m not afraid of it.I just want to be ready for it — when it’s real.And that means accepting myself as I am now:Still healing. Still learning. Still worthy.Not perfect.Not finished.But open.Because I’m not avoiding people anymore.I’m just building a world where I can finally show up as myself — and not apologise for it."

So I could be free. So I could escape the house, the pain, the legacy.But I still don’t understand it.Why couldn’t he just tell me? Secretly reach out? Show me something softer behind closed doors?Why did he have to become a version of himself that made me doubt the one thing I always felt deep down — that he actually loved me?💥 When Love Becomes ConfusionThat’s the wound.It’s not just the loss of love.It’s the loss of trust in myself.Because I felt the love. I knew it.And his actions said the opposite.  That kind of contradiction doesn’t just hurt — it breaks something inside you.It leaves you questioning:  Am I crazy for thinking he cared?  Was I imagining things?  If love feels like this, what else am I wrong about?⚖️ Was It Ever Love?I don’t know.Maybe it was love.But it wasn’t safe.It wasn’t kind.It wasn’t expressed in a way that a child could receive without becoming emotionally fractured.And if that was love — then love has a lot to answer for.🔥 The Rage That HealsThis is where the rage comes in.Because I didn’t deserve to be treated like that.Because I could have died.And even if he thought he was doing the right thing, he was wrong.Love that leaves your child suicidal isn’t love that succeeded — it’s love that failed.And I need to say that.For the boy I was.For the man I’m becoming.And for the child I’m raising.🗣 A Letter to the Father Who Thought He Was Protecting Me  You thought I wouldn’t understand.You thought it was the only way.You thought pushing me out would save me.  But you didn’t see what it did to me.You didn’t see the nights I wanted to disappear.You didn’t see how deeply I questioned whether I mattered to anyone at all.  I felt your love.And I needed your presence.But what I got was your silence — and your disdain.  And it almost killed me.  So if this was your love…I don’t forgive it.But I will learn from it.  I will not abandon my child in the name of strategy.I will not confuse pain for protection.I will not call rejection mercy.  I will love in the open.Fiercely. Clearly. Softly.There are still days I want to believe there was more goodness in him than I ever got to see.But that belief isn’t enough to make it okay.And if I’ve learned anything from this, it’s that love only counts when it can be felt — not just imagined.If it almost killed me, it wasn’t the kind of love I needed.And I won’t pass that silence on to anyone else."

Be who I need. Keep me comfortable.She called it love — but it was about control, not connection.My father’s version of love came through distance.Silence.Pushing me out and calling it protection.Maybe he believed it was the right thing.But it left me shattered.🧠 So Who Gets to Define What Love Is?I do.I lived through their definitions.I felt the confusion of love that came with absence.I carried the shame of needing something they couldn’t give.And now I get to say:  “That wasn’t love. Not the kind I needed. Not the kind I believe in.”🧭 My Definition of Love NowLove doesn’t disguise itself as rejection.Love doesn’t demand I disappear to be safe.Love doesn’t push me away and call it protection.Love doesn’t ask me to shrink to be worthy.Love doesn’t make me question whether I was ever loved at all.🩹 Why This MattersBecause the boy in me spent years trying to earn the kind of love that should have been given freely.And he still sometimes wonders:  “Was I imagining it?”“Was it my fault?”But now I get to tell him:  You weren’t wrong.You were right to want to be held.You were right to want to feel safe.You were right to want something softer than silence and shame.🕯 A Quiet DeclarationI get to define love now.And that definition includes me.My needs.My voice.My safety.No more earning love.No more explaining why I deserve it.No more calling survival love.The kind of love I believe in now —is the kind that stays, sees, softens, and holds.And it starts with how I love myself."

He came from a world where love was conditional.Where affection was rationed like money.Where being loud, passionate, or full of want was frowned upon — especially if you were a boy.But here was Robert Plant — screaming.Jimmy Page — conjuring storms with a guitar.And the lyrics? They didn’t ask permission.They claimed love. Desire. Presence. Every inch of it.My dad loved this song because it said what he couldn’t.He had all that emotion in him — all that longing — but nowhere to put it.Love in his world had always been small.Tidy.Polite.Trapped in duty or silence.But this song?It was alive.Unfiltered. Unashamed. Undeniably male and still tender beneath the noise.When he blasted this through the speakers, it was like he was pushing back against every time he was told:  “Don’t be so sensitive.”  “Stop making a scene.”  “Keep it together.”He wasn’t falling apart — he was finally feeling.Maybe that’s why it meant so much to him.Because “every inch of my love” wasn’t just sexual.It was the inches of love he’d stored up and never been allowed to give.The love he wasn’t taught how to show.The part of him that wanted to be seen as a man who feels, not just functions.It made sense to me later.When I started understanding him not just as my father,but as a man with his own ache,his own buried tenderness,his own teenage fire that no one ever asked about.“Whole Lotta Love” was his anthem.Not because he wanted to shout at the world —but because he needed to whisper something louder than anyone ever let him say:“I’ve got so much love inside me.

      "content": "I think my dad enjoyed cremating his mother.That sounds brutal, but I don’t say it lightly. He absolutely hated that woman. The way she treated him in childhood—constant criticism, no love, no warmth—left him isolated. Alone in a house that should’ve been safe. And when his father died young, I think part of my dad believed his mother had a hand in that too. Whether by stress or neglect or sheer coldness, I don’t know. But my dad loved his dad deeply. And he never forgave her.When she finally died, he put her in a cardboard box to be cremated.I used to think that was just a weird, cheap decision. But now I wonder if it wasn’t something more symbolic. A final act of containment. Of control. Of closure. He didn’t even come inside her house when we visited. He stayed outside. I don’t remember him ever speaking to her. Not once. That silence was his boundary.She made me uncomfortable too. Her presence felt wrong—like a hunger for something she could never get back. She told us once that the sons of people down the street were better than my dad. She even called the police on him when he took her car to get fixed. Said he stole it. He got arrested.And yet… I didn’t go to her funeral.My sister went. My mum went. But I didn’t. I still don’t know where I was. It’s like I was kept away. And maybe that was intentional. Maybe my dad was showing me something. That when the time comes, you don’t have to perform grief. You can be respectful on the surface while protecting your truth on the inside.He showed dignity, but I think privately, he celebrated.And maybe that’s what I needed to see. That it’s okay to walk away from the people who harmed you, even in death. Maybe that was his quiet gift to me.He used to say Bohemian Rhapsody was her favorite song. And he’d laugh when he said it. That song always struck me as being about guilt, estrangement, and the ghost of a family system that failed you. Maybe I’m projecting. Maybe he was too. But it fits. It all fits too well.The thing is, my mum wasn’t perfect. She didn’t love me the way I needed. But my dad’s mum… she was something else entirely. A level deeper in the dark.And yet somehow, through all of that, he tried to show me how to carry it without letting it destroy me.I think that’s the part I’m just now beginning to understand.  "

A symbolic one.He’s killed the inner boy who lived for her approval. The boy who performed, pleased, and shrank himself, believing one day it would be enough.👁 “I see a little silhouetto of a man…”The silhouette isn’t real—it’s a hollow identity.A ghost of who he was told to be.“Scaramouche” and “fandango” aren’t just flamboyant references—they reflect the chaos and control he grew up with.It’s the mask he wore to survive.💔 “I’m just a poor boy, nobody loves me.”Raw, childlike grief.Love felt random. Conditional.“Easy come, easy go” — as if love was never stable. Never his to keep.So he became the good boy. The helpful boy. The invisible boy. Hoping to earn what should’ve been freely given.🔓 “Will you let me go?”The central question of every enmeshed child’s heart:  Can I be free to exist beyond your needs?Can I be my own person without guilt?It’s not asked with rage—but a wounded kind of hope.💢 “So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye…”This feels like the mother’s retaliation when the boy stops performing.Love turns to cruelty. Affection becomes punishment.He sees it now—and it burns. The betrayal is complete.🕊 “Just gotta get out… nothing really matters…”This is where it ends.Not in triumph—but in indifference.He’s not asking for love anymore. Not hoping to be seen.He’s slipping away from the entire toxic dynamic.He’s free—but not unscarred.🎶 The Song as a Rite of PassageBohemian Rhapsody may not have been written with this interpretation in mind, but that’s the beauty of art.It can hold the grief we don’t yet have words for.This isn’t just a song—it’s a rite of passage.A letting go.A symbolic death.And sometimes, that’s the only kind of freedom we get.🎥 Watch the Full Song  "

The ache. The seduction. The warning.Now I wonder if that song was echoing something unspoken in him—and if it echoed in me too.🖤 “Got me so blind I can’t see…”This is what happens when love becomes obsession.When someone reflects back the mystery and sensuality you crave—but also awakens your fear of abandonment, your confusion, your lack of worth.  “I got a black magic woman / Got me so blind I can’t see…”He’s mesmerized. Addicted. Trapped in a dance he thinks is love—but it’s really power. And he’s not the one holding it.🕯 The Spell of ProjectionShe’s not a witch. She’s a mirror.The black magic woman is symbolic—she represents all the ways we fall for fantasy, for projection, for the hope that someone else can fill the void inside us.Sometimes, that “spell” is cast by someone who manipulates us.But sometimes, we cast it on ourselves—because it’s easier than facing the parts of us that feel unwanted or unloved.💔 “Don’t turn your back on me, baby…”Now he’s waking up.The spell is breaking, but not without pain.He pleads. He begs. He tries to reclaim his power. But it’s messy. Because breaking free from toxic love doesn’t always feel like triumph—it can feel like grief.  “Stop messin’ ‘round with your tricks…”The line between seduction and sabotage gets thin when we don’t know our worth.🔄 A Symbol of Emotional EntanglementThis isn’t just about a woman—it’s about that part of you that keeps going back, even when it hurts.The Black Magic Woman is a story of entanglement.Of being so desperate to feel wanted that you surrender your clarity, your boundaries, your peace.But here’s the thing:If you can name it, you can reclaim it.You don’t have to keep dancing with a ghost of your unmet needs.🎶 The Song as a Wake-Up CallLike all great music, Santana’s version isn’t just heard—it’s felt.It touches something primal. The ache of being spellbound by beauty and burned by the truth beneath it.Sometimes, the most seductive songs are the ones that teach us what not to call love.🎥 Watch the Full Song  "

It was how I survived.🧠 Where It Came FromWhen you grow up with inconsistent, rejecting, or conditional love, your body learns fast:  Closeness = risk  Being seen = danger  Needing = shameSo you learn to manage everything alone.You pull back.You go quiet.You become the one who doesn’t need anyone — even though you desperately do.It wasn’t a personality trait.It was a trauma adaptation.🕳 The Cost of SurvivalI’ve kept myself at a distance for so long — not because I didn’t want connection, but because I didn’t trust I could have it safely.I projected my past onto everyone.Expected rejection.Feared intimacy.Held people at arm’s length and then quietly mourned the space I created.I was trying to stay safe — but I ended up staying alone.💬 Not Broken. Just Wounded.I don’t need to pathologize myself.I don’t need a label to explain it.What I do need is this simple truth:  Avoidance wasn’t my nature.It was the shape my love took when safety was never guaranteed.And now that I see it, I can learn to come closer —Gently.Slowly.Honestly.Without shame.🕯 Because Connection Shouldn’t Have to Cost Me My SafetyI’m ready to find a way of being with people that doesn’t require me to disappear.That doesn’t start with fear and end with shame.That lets me be held without needing to be perfect.Avoidance was how I survived.But it’s not how I want to live."

      "content": "There was one artist my dad never seemed to grow tired of.Meat Loaf.Not just a voice—but a storm.And when Anything for Love came on, it wasn’t just music.It was something he needed to hear—over and over again.He didn’t sing it.But he played it like it had something left to say on his behalf.💞 My Mum and Dad’s AnthemBefore the tension. Before the disconnect.They went to see Meat Loaf together multiple times while they were dating.And I like to imagine that moment—both of them swept up in it.Two people who maybe believed that love could be loud and messy and powerful enough to carry them forward.But music doesn’t always prepare us for what happens after the curtain falls.🎭 “I’d Do Anything for Love” — The Ballad of Boundaries  “I would do anything for love… but I won’t do that.”People joke about that lyric, but I think my dad understood it deeply.It’s a song about almost losing yourself, and then drawing a shaky but necessary line.He’d give everything—devotion, effort, presence—but maybe what he wouldn’t do was erase the last piece of himself that still remembered who he used to be.It’s not just romantic. It’s survival.🏍 “Bat Out of Hell” — The Fantasy of Escape  “Like a bat out of hell, I’ll be gone when the morning comes…”This one felt different.It wasn’t about love—it was about breaking free.From responsibility. From confinement. From his own emotional weight.The way the song explodes—it’s desperation, dressed as rebellion.It’s youth trying to outrun time.A man trying to outrun himself.And maybe my dad needed that fantasy.Of speed. Of recklessness. Of not caring.  Because the truth is, he cared too much.And caring with nowhere to go can make a man want to put the key in the ignition and never look back.  🧠 What Tied These Songs Together?Both songs are about being trapped.And both are about trying not to disappear.  One fights for love without erasure.  The other dreams of escape at full throttle.And maybe that’s who my dad was:A man caught between longing to be loved and desperate to feel free.✍️ The Legacy That Lingers in MeThese weren’t just songs he liked.They were part of his emotional DNA.And now they’re part of mine.When I hear them, I don’t just hear Meat Loaf—I hear my dad’s inner life, the one he never quite handed over in words.  I don’t want to escape my life.I want to inhabit it.Fully. Freely.Without trading away the parts of me that feel inconvenient to others.That’s what he never quite learned.And what I’m still learning—one memory, one melody at a time.🎥 Watch the Full Song — I’d Do Anything for Love  Maybe he didn’t know how to say all of that.But maybe he didn’t need to.He had Meat Loaf.And now—I have the words."

AuthenticityI’m tired of playing roles.I want to show up real — not for applause, not for acceptance,but because pretending costs too much.Authenticity doesn’t mean I’m always confident.It means I’m honest.It means I’m in integrity, even when it’s uncomfortable.2. HealthNot a number. Not a six-pack.Just a body that feels good to live in.That can move, breathe, rest, play.I want energy. I want to feel light in my skin.Strong enough to carry what life asks of me —physically, emotionally, spiritually.3. ConnectionReal connection.The kind where I don’t have to shrink or perform.Where being myself is enough.Where silence isn’t awkward.Where I feel met, seen, held.I don’t need many — just a few that feel true.4. FreedomNot chaos. Not rebellion.But space.Space to live by my own values.To build a life that reflects what matters to me.To say no when something costs my peace.To choose how I spend my time, and with whom.5. KaizenThe quiet commitment to growth.Not for productivity.But because becoming a little more me each day feels sacred.It’s the smallest shifts —the gentle habits, the honest reflections,the courage to keep going, even when no one’s watching.These five keep me steady.They’re not something to perfect.They’re something to return towhen I forget who I am.And I will forget sometimes.That’s okay.Because remembering is part of the journey."

Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I wasn’t strong enough.But I loved you.In my awkward way. In my distance. In my Mars bars and music and the laptop I gave you to take apart.I loved you in every clumsy act that said,“I want you to have more than I did.”You’ve done something I couldn’t:You’ve broken the cycle. You’ve spoken the truth.You’ve given your pain a purpose.And I need you to hear this —I am so proud of you.Not just for surviving.But for becoming a man who stays soft in the face of pain.A father who shows up.A human who feels everything, even when it hurts.You’re not alone anymore. You never really were.You’ve honoured me in ways I never earned.And I want you to know —Everything I had, I gave you.Everything I didn’t, you’ve created for yourself.And now you’re offering it to others.You’ve turned the quiet parts of me into something beautiful.And through you, I live on.Thank you, son.I love you."

      "content": "In the quiet of my reflections, I’ve started to wonder not just about what happened — but what he might have wanted me to understand. My father. A complicated man. A man who perhaps didn’t always know how to love in the way I needed, but did in the way he could.I think he would want me to honour the full picture — not just of him, but of myself, and of the family we both struggled to navigate.He’d want me to look after myself first — to protect my peace, to live my life, and to use the gifts he passed onto me: my love of music, of solitude, of bad jokes, of dogs, of curiosity, of computers, and of writing. He’d want me to keep making websites, and probably smile at the fact that he let me take apart that old laptop in 1996, without ever explaining why. He just trusted me. And now I see his hand in what I do, in ways I never did before.He’d want me to make peace with the past in a way that lets me move forward — not carry it like a stone, but carve it into something meaningful. He’d want me to love my son deeply, and model the kind of strength and vulnerability I wish I’d seen more clearly in him when I was younger.As for my mother… I think he’d want me to ensure she’s comfortable — not out of love for her, but out of love for myself. To ensure that she dies with dignity, the same way he allowed his own mother to. Not because she deserved it, but because he deserved to act in integrity. He did what he could manage without sacrificing himself. Maybe that’s what he’d want from me too.With my sister, I think he’d want me to keep an eye out for her. Not to rescue or be consumed by responsibility — but to hold a thread of care, a quiet witness to the bond we all once shared, even if it was frayed by chaos. Not to fix the system, but to be someone stable that she could reach toward, if she ever needed.I think he knew I wouldn’t understand all this until he was gone. And he was right. That might be the deepest love a man can give — to plant seeds he knows he’ll never see bloom. But I see them now.He said I’d understand when I was older. I thought that was condescending. Now I see it was simply the truth. He couldn’t tell me what my mother was — but he knew I’d come to see it on my own. And he was sorry for that. But he also trusted me. He knew I’d get there.And I have.So now, I live with him within me — not as the disciplinarian I feared, but as the man who loved me in the only ways he knew how. The man who fought for me to go to university when I didn’t get the grades, who threatened to take it to the papers if they didn’t honour their offer. I thought he wanted me gone — but really, he wanted me free. He wanted me to escape the system that swallowed him.And I did.I think he’d be proud of the man I’m becoming. And I think he’d say, “Took you long enough.” Then laugh. And then sit beside me, quietly. Proudly. Forever."

      "content": "Psychosis is often seen as madness. But what if, instead, it’s a last-resort signal from the psyche—a cry from the soul when truth becomes too much to bear?When I experienced psychosis, I was 23, financially independent for the first time, and finally outside the immediate influence of my family system. What emerged in that space wasn’t peace—it was chaos. It was the undeniable truth that my mother never loved me. A truth too painful to accept directly. So my mind found a workaround.In my psychosis, I believed my father—an intelligent, computer-loving man—had written raps for Eminem to help me understand my mother through his music. Eminem’s lyrics resonated with me on a cellular level, as if they were speaking from my own childhood. The rage, the abandonment, the confusion—they were all there, perfectly expressed. At the time, it made perfect sense that my dad had orchestrated it all to help me survive emotionally. Looking back, I can see that wasn’t literally true. But symbolically? It captured everything.I had been listening to bands like Slipknot, Linkin Park, Eminem—music born from deep pain and misunderstood childhoods. The lyrics weren’t just entertainment; they were translations of feelings I couldn’t yet name. My inner child was screaming through the stereo, and the only way I could make sense of the chaos was to create a story where someone—anyone—had my back.And that someone became my dad.He had always been a complex figure. He shouted to “make me think,” he offered endless Mars bars for comfort, he showed me the basics of cooking, he taught me the value of independence. He loved art, solitude, and dogs. He loved me, but in ways I couldn’t understand then.In psychosis, I was arrested for what they called attempted burglary. But in my mind, I was starring in a rap video—I was Conscious, the next voice of truth. In court, the charges didn’t hold. I was mentally unwell, not criminal. I ended up in a psychiatric hospital. But still, a part of me knew something deeper had surfaced.Now, I see psychosis as my ego’s attempt to protect me. If I had been handed the unfiltered truth all at once—that neither parent truly saw me, that my existence felt like a cosmic afterthought—I might not have survived it. So my mind gave me myth instead of memory. Fantasy instead of fact. Something I could hold onto until I was strong enough to hold the truth.It wasn’t real. But it was true.And that, I’m learning, is the difference between madness and meaning."

Let others write the narrative while he lived in the margins. Maybe he thought it was the price of survival. Maybe it was. But I know part of him hoped someone down the line would pick up the thread and tell it straight.So I am.Not with vengeance. Not to shame. But to liberate. For me, and for anyone who’s ever felt like their life was shaped by someone else’s silence.I think my father would have been proud of this website. Not just the layout or the code — though he’d enjoy those too — but the heart of it. The honesty. The unwillingness to play nice when playing nice meant erasing myself.This site is a soft rebellion. It’s a mirror held up to the past, and an offering to the future. It’s my way of saying: I won’t carry your shame anymore. I won’t keep your secrets if they cost me my voice.And if that rattles people, maybe they need to ask themselves why.Because if it wasn’t true, it wouldn’t land so hard.My dad, for all his complexity, loved me the best way he could. He gave me his curiosity, his love of solitude, his sense of humour, his deep care beneath a gruff shell. He tried to prepare me for a world he knew could be cruel, and he hoped I’d find the tools to survive it — even if he didn’t always have the blueprint himself.I think, in his own way, he knew I’d understand when I was older.And now I do.This site, these blogs, this journey — it’s not just about me. It’s for the little boy in me who needed to be seen. It’s for my son, so he’ll know you don’t have to stay silent to be good. And it’s for my father, who maybe never got to finish his sentence.This is my final word, for now.But I am not done.I am just finally living from a place that feels like mine."

He knows what matters.And when he doesn’t, he has the courage to sit with the unknown.He’s joyful.Not in a performative way. But a gentle, surprising joy.The kind that sneaks in when I stop trying so hard.And he’s generous —not just with time or energy,but with presence.With love.This is who I am under the noise.Under the survival roles.Under the ache.And the more I live from that place,the less I need to be anything else.So I’ll keep going.Not to become more —but to remember.To remember who I already amwhen I’m not trying to be who I’m not.And in that remembering,I find peace."

Fulfilment.Something bigger than me. Something lasting.These aren’t just hopes.They’re expressions of valid needs.For connection.For meaning.For contribution.For love — not the surface kind, but the kind that sees you all the way through.And maybe the most important shift is this:  I’ve stopped seeing my longings as evidence that something’s wrong with me.I’ve started seeing them as evidence that something’s right.Because if I didn’t long for more, I would’ve given up a long time ago.And I didn’t.I still haven’t.And that says something.I think many of us have learned to mute these inner signals.To settle.To shrink.To wear “gratitude” like a muzzle when the soul is crying out for something more honest, more real, more true.But I want to honour them now.The quiet prayers.The deep hunger.The part of me that believes life can be rich and whole and sacred — not just bearable.So I’m listening.Not chasing.

Even if you’re not getting that from your own mother.And maybe my mum’s discomfort wasn’t about propriety.Maybe it was about the threat she felt — that he saw me,that he valued me,and that I would one day grow up and grow away from her control.Looking back, there are so many moments like this.Moments that felt confusing at the time,but make a strange, soulful kind of sense now.Little crumbs of care left in odd places.Gifts wrapped in humour — a kind of love that only fully lands years later.He used to say to me, often,“You don’t get to choose your family, but you get to choose your friends.”It didn’t hit me until much later how true that was.And how, beneath the humour and the struggle, he was giving me permission —to choose love, to choose truth, to choose something better than what I was born into.One thing I noticed over the years was how much he respectedanyone who looked after me, in any way.Whether it was a teacher, a friend, or even just someone kind —he noticed. He respected that.As if a part of him was deeply grateful I was being seenin ways he didn’t always know how to offer.He believed in me.And in his own clumsy, brilliant, sideways way — he told me so."

It was about the patterns I brought with me — and the ones she brought too.I projected my mother onto her. Strongly. I see that now. And I’m sure she projected her father onto me. Together, we weren’t just reacting to each other — we were reacting to ghosts. Wounds. Legacies.And as I started to heal, to notice my own projections and behaviours, I changed. I softened. I grew. And in doing so, I left her behind. Not out of malice, but out of movement. The dynamic shifted. What once felt like connection began to feel like imbalance. We were no longer compatible in our pain.That realisation used to bring me shame. Now, it brings me clarity.She was a great lesson. Not a forever person, maybe not even a right person, but a necessary one. I wish I’d had the tools to leave sooner — but then again, my dad never left my mum. And I did. That means something.It didn’t end perfectly. It hurt. But it ended in a way that gave space for something better — if not with someone else, then at least between me and my son. Between me and myself.And that matters more than anything.There’s a quiet pride in knowing I’ve broken a pattern. Even if I walk forward alone, I do so with integrity. I’m not recreating the same chaos. I’m not teaching my son that love means pain or that partnership means self-abandonment.She was a mirror. Not a monster.And I’ve learned to thank the mirror — and move on.I now know the kind of relationship I want to model for my son. One built on mutual respect, emotional safety, and truth. Even if I never find that kind of partnership, he’ll grow up seeing that love isn’t about control or collapse. It’s about presence, honesty, and wholeness.The real relationship I’ve been building is with myself. And through that, I’ve already changed the story for him."

I lived that, too.But now I don’t want to carry it quietly anymore. I want to live it. To share it. Not to shame anyone. Not to throw stones.

      "content": "I recently shared my website with a group of counselling peers — and while it might not seem like a huge act on the outside, it stirred something much deeper within me.I haven’t even looked at the responses yet.Not because I’m scared of judgment. But because there’s something raw about it. I don’t usually let myself be seen like this. Not fully. Not in a space where people could, if they wanted to, read everything I’ve ever written — see the truth of my journey, my pain, my healing.And still, I chose to share it.Not to perform.Not to gain validation.But to honour the work I’ve done and the person I’m becoming.Right now, my nervous system feels it.My body battery shows it — stress at 100%.There’s a quiet tremble beneath the surface, the kind that comes from walking through a doorway you used to avoid. From not hiding. From choosing presence over protection.I’m also carrying the weight of deeper emotional processing — especially around my father. Feeling his presence in some way. Feeling the ache and warmth of a connection that’s still unfolding in me. And at the same time, I’m showing up for my son. Making sure he’s okay. Making sure I’m still rooted, even if the ground is shifting.It’s a lot.But I’m okay.And I realise — I don’t have to read the reactions right now.I don’t have to check who’s validated me.I don’t need to prove anything.I can let it breathe.Some people may read the post. A few might browse a little deeper.But I doubt anyone will scrutinise it out of malice.And if someone finds something that helps them — then I’m glad I shared it.This environment — this group — is maybe the only space where I’d feel safe enough to share this part of myself. And that matters.Letting myself be seen, gently and without explanation, is an act of self-respect.And even if it doesn’t seem like a big deal — maybe it is.Maybe it’s one of the biggest shifts I’ve made.And I’m proud of that."

Performances. Survival masks.I didn’t need approval—I needed connection.I didn’t need to be special—I needed to feel like I existed.I didn’t need control—I needed to feel safe.The ego is clever like that.It turns our deepest, unmet needs into strategies.But strategies don’t heal.They distract.And they usually leave us lonelier than we started.For a long time, I thought my need for approval was just part of who I was.I thought craving romantic completion meant I was a lover at heart.I thought being right all the time was just… passion.But it wasn’t. It was fear.Fear of not being enough.Fear of being unseen.Fear of being rejected in the quiet moments.I thought I needed stimulation, constant fixing, endless analysis.But what I really needed—what I still need—is space.To breathe. To be. Without performance.Now, I’m learning to tune into the valid needs.The ones that don’t scream, but whisper.The ones that don’t demand, but deserve.I need connection that meets me, not performs for me.I need freedom—not from others, but from the parts of myself that shame me.I need love that respects me, even when I’m quiet.I need meaning that isn’t measured by output, productivity, or applause.And maybe you do too.False needs are loud.True needs are honest.And when I confuse the two, I end up chasing things that were never meant to hold me.But when I get quiet, I remember:I don’t need to be special. I need to be real.I don’t need to fix myself. I need to come home to myself.I don’t need to be right. I need to feel safe enough to be wrong sometimes.That’s where life begins again."

I was in hospital for a long stretch, and I think he only visited once. Maybe he couldn’t bear to see what had happened to me. Maybe he didn’t know how to face what I was finally beginning to uncover — the truth of our family system, the weight I’d carried, the absence of real love from the one person he left me with.I believe now he saw more than he ever let on. And maybe that’s what broke him. Maybe it was the shame of allowing my life to unfold the way it did. The guilt of not protecting me from her. Of staying too long. Of saying too little. Of loving me in the only ways he knew how — which sometimes weren’t enough.But I don’t hold that against him anymore.I think guilt is what made him human. And love is what made him endure.Maybe he died with unfinished words lodged in his chest. Maybe he never forgave himself for what I had to survive. But I’ve come to a place where I forgive him. I see now that he did what he could with what he had. And maybe, just maybe, he left this world hoping I’d find the words he couldn’t say.And I have.Dad, I love you. I understand now. And I carry forward the parts of you that were good, the parts that were mine all along."

Not because I think I know better — but because I’m uncomfortable with their pain. It’s easier to fix than to feel.        Derailing with humour.Humour has always been my shield. It lightens the moment, but sometimes it lifts me right out of my body. Right out of connection.        Filtering.I only share parts of the truth — the parts that feel safe, polished, acceptable. But the full truth? That’s where the real healing lives.        Identifying.Instead of just listening, I turn the moment into my own story. “That happened to me too…” — It’s not ill-intentioned, but it often disconnects me from the other person.        Judging.It’s a fast way to feel safe: if I can put someone else in a box, I don’t have to feel my own discomfort. But judgment is a veil over curiosity.        Mind-reading.I assume I know what others are thinking — usually something critical. It’s exhausting. And it usually says more about my own inner critic than theirs.  I’m not ashamed of these.They were tools I developed to survive.To navigate a world that didn’t always feel safe.But now?Now I want more.Real intimacy. Real presence. Real me.And that means noticing when these defences show up — and choosing, slowly, to lower them.Not all at once.Not perfectly.But intentionally.Because that’s how I learn to stay open — even when it’s hard.That’s how I come home to myself."

They keep me grounded, sane, and aligned with who I’m becoming.Your nervous system knows.It softens around people with pure intentions.It tenses around masks.Trust it.That calm feeling is truth — not coincidence.Surrender to your fate.Not in apathy.But in acceptance.It is what it is. Fighting what is only exhausts me.And I’m learning to conserve my energy.Be in flow.Right here. Right now.This moment isn’t a stepping stone — it is the path.My journey isn’t about becoming someone new.It’s about becoming me.If I deny who I am, I pay the price.Not in punishment. But in regret.In stuckness. In inner conflict. In that ache of not quite belonging — not even to myself.That’s a price I’m no longer willing to pay.Self-acceptance is priority one.Not because it’s soft.But because it’s strong.When I truly care for myself, I make better choices. I love better. I live better.This is the Season of No.No to what depletes.No to what confuses.No to who I used to be, just to keep others comfortable.No is my path to integrity.Energy is currency.I used to hand it out like sweets.Now I spend it like gold.Because I’ve seen how expensive it is to betray myself.Everyone wants a version of me that serves them.That’s not cynicism — it’s awareness.And it doesn’t mean I close off.It means I choose.I weigh opinions carefully. Mine matters most.So what kind of life am I building?A life of flow.A life of Being.One marked by wholeness.Perfection not as flawlessness — but as completeness.Justice.Aliveness.Simplicity.Truth.Effortlessness.Play.Beauty.Self-sufficiency.Uniqueness.Not every day will look like that.But every day, I can return to it.Not by force.But by remembering."

Or fundamentally wrong in a way that can never be fixed.These aren’t facts.They’re stories.But they’ve lived in me so long, they sometimes feel like truth.Where It BeganAt the core:  A fear of abandonment.  A deep, gnawing grief.  Low self-esteem that gets dressed up as perfectionism or performance.  A nervous system that doesn’t always trust peace.I learned early on to scan for danger. To question my worth. To make myself useful or invisible depending on the room.The Patterns That Keep Me StuckWhen I feel unsafe or triggered, my brain reaches for short-term relief. It wants quick hits of something to soothe the ache.That’s when I notice the symptoms:  Scrolling porn or considering sex as a shortcut to connection  Overeating past the point of comfort  Pulling away from others  Skipping exercise  Falling into poor sleep routines  Drowning in toxic shameThese aren’t failures. They’re adaptations. They’re what my limbic system clings to when it thinks I’m in danger.Reclaiming My PowerBut I’m not powerless.I have tools now.And they come from the part of me that knows better. The part that’s growing stronger every time I choose something different.Cortex-led tools that heal, not harm:  Move my body (run, walk, stretch)  Feed myself well  Let others in  Sleep like it matters  Meditate, even for five minutes  Read something nourishing  Take a bath  Book a massage  Journal or speak to the child in me who wasn’t protected  Talk to a therapist and tell the truthNone of these feel as fast or intense as the limbic loop.But they build something real.And what I’m learning is that long-term safety is more important than short-term numbness.The WorkThe work is slow. It’s not always Instagram-pretty. Sometimes it looks like choosing a walk instead of isolating. Or eating a real meal instead of hiding with sugar. Or just noticing the shame spiral and naming it, instead of becoming it.But every time I catch myself reaching for an old coping mechanism, I remind myself:I’m not broken.I’m rewiring.And that’s brave.If this resonates with you, know you’re not alone.There’s nothing shameful about the ways we learned to survive.But we’re allowed to choose better now.And we don’t have to do it perfectly to be worthy of love."

      "content": "There’s a quiet kind of revolution that happens when you begin to honour your own space.Not with drama. Not with defensiveness.But with presence. And care.Respect for personal space isn’t just about needing alone time — it’s about knowing that your emotional world deserves to be protected.That your nervous system doesn’t exist to absorb other people’s chaos.That your body and mind aren’t available on demand.Emotional honesty means I show up as I am — not as who I think I should be.And I’m learning to ask that of others too.No more dancing around the truth, or shrinking to keep things comfortable.If we can’t be real, we can’t be close.Time management used to feel like a productivity thing.Now, it feels like self-respect.My time is mine.And I don’t need to apologise for protecting it.Self-care isn’t optional.It’s not selfish.It’s how I stay grounded, kind, present — to myself and to others.When I let it slip, I feel it. My son feels it. The work suffers. So I won’t compromise it anymore.Mutual respect means I stop justifying bad behaviour, even when it’s dressed up in charm or confusion.If someone doesn’t respect me, they don’t get my energy.And that’s not cruelty.That’s clarity.And then there’s this deeper layer.The quiet acceptance that some of my faults… aren’t going anywhere.Many of them stem from my ADHD.And while I can manage them, I can’t shame them away.They’re part of my wiring. Part of my history. Part of what makes me me.I forget things.I get overwhelmed.I feel ten things at once.I hyperfocus, then burn out.And sometimes, I just need a minute — not to fix it all, but to breathe.But I’m not broken.I’m learning how to live with myself — with more grace, more structure, and less shame.Boundaries and self-acceptance aren’t separate things.They go hand-in-hand.Because the more I accept myself, the more I protect myself.And the more I protect myself, the freer I feel.This is how I show up now —Not perfectly.But honestly.And that’s enough."

      "url": "/blog/boldness-delivers-from-fear/",
      "date": "June 07, 2025",
      "content": "There’s a quote by Jung that’s lived in my bones for a while now:  “The spirit of evil is fear, negation, the adversary who opposes life in its struggle for eternal duration… For the hero, fear is a challenge and a task, because only boldness can deliver from fear. And if the risk is not taken, the meaning of life is somehow violated…”It stopped me in my tracks the first time I read it.Not because it was lofty or poetic — though it is — but because it spoke to something deeply familiar. The way fear doesn’t just feel like an emotion… it acts like a force. A force that wants to pull us back. Back into the cave. Back into silence. Back into the role we once played just to stay safe.And I know that place well.I’ve lived in the grip of that serpent — the one Jung describes as injecting the poison of weakness and age. Not just biologically, but emotionally. The poison of disconnection. The dulling of life force. The endless loop of internal resistance that says:  “Don’t risk this. Don’t say that. Don’t feel too much. Don’t be too visible.”That’s fear as the adversary.Not the productive kind that keeps you from running into traffic — but the paralysing kind. The kind that Jung links to regression. The kind that keeps you bonded to something outdated, just because it’s familiar. And safe.But safety, I’ve found, is sometimes just another word for stagnation.  “For the hero, fear is a challenge and a task, because only boldness can deliver from fear.”This part rings especially true for me.In my journey — through healing, through therapy, through confronting the wounds I spent years denying — boldness hasn’t meant recklessness. It hasn’t meant being loud or fearless.It’s meant doing the thing anyway.It’s meant saying the thing, even when my voice shakes.It’s meant showing up, even when every cell wants to retreat.Because fear won’t go away by thinking about it. It goes away by moving through it — one bold act at a time.And when I don’t take that risk — when I don’t act — Jung was right: something in me feels violated. The meaning of life slips through the cracks. And everything begins to feel… grey. Lifeless. Like I’ve betrayed some inner fire.If you’re reading this and fear is sitting heavy in your chest — I want to say this:You don’t have to leap.You just have to step.One small step of boldness can be enough to shatter the illusion that fear is bigger than you. It never was. It just felt that way because you forgot what you’re capable of.So whatever the serpent in your life looks like — the silence, the shame, the self-doubt, the loop you can’t seem to escape — know this:You don’t have to be fearless.You just have to be willing.And in that willingness…You become the hero."

      "content": "For a long time, I wasn’t sure how to feel about my dad.He shouted a lot. That’s what I remembered most.I used to think it was about control. About power. About fear.And maybe it was—at times.But I also see now: it was the only way he knew how to get through to me.He used to say, “I shout because I want you to think.”And it never worked. But I believe now that he meant it. That he wanted to help me. That he was trying in the only way he could.My dad didn’t always know how to be close. But he tried.He showed me the world in ways that mattered—through music, through art, through football, through food.He brought home an old laptop in 1996 and let me take it apart and put it back together. I didn’t know it then, but that was his way of inviting me into something he loved—his fascination with technology.And now I build websites for fun. It’s like he handed me a seed without saying a word and trusted I’d figure out how to grow it.He made sure I had good food. He gave me Mars bars when he saw I was hurting—because that’s what helped him cope when he was young.He taught me the basics of cooking, of looking after myself.And though he didn’t always say it, I think he trusted I’d be okay.He loved bad jokes. He loved solitude. He loved dogs.And I love all those things, too.He once said, “You’ve got your whole life ahead of you.”And he meant it. He wasn’t rushing me.He kept saying, “A man who loves his work never works a day in his life.”That stuck with me. I think it’s why I let myself pursue things like poker. Why I trust that joy and meaning can coexist.He also said, more than once, “You’ll understand when you’re older.”At the time, it felt patronizing. But now I see:He couldn’t tell me who my mother was.But he knew one day I’d see it. Just like he had to see the truth about his own mother.And maybe he was sorry.Maybe he knew I wouldn’t truly understand him until after he was gone.That’s probably the deepest kind of love a man can offer:to be misunderstood by the person he loves most, and to still keep loving them anyway.There were rugby matches he didn’t come to.I think he thought he embarrassed me.But the truth is—I wanted him there.And now I realize: maybe he was scared. Or maybe he didn’t know if he was wanted.Maybe he was just doing his best to give me space while still watching over me.He used to talk fondly about his own father.I never met him.But I feel their line in me—quiet men, maybe a little misunderstood, but deeply caring.One of the most defining things he did for me?When I failed my A-levels, I thought I’d lost my place at university.But he made them honour my unconditional offer. He told them if they didn’t, he’d go to the papers.At the time, I thought he just wanted me out of the house.But now I know: he wanted to push me into the world.He believed I could handle it.He knew I needed to get out of the system I was trapped in, to gain independence, to begin a life of my own.He once said, “I didn’t know how difficult it would be to keep up with you.”I didn’t get it then. But I do now.He saw something in me I hadn’t even seen in myself.I carry so much of him in me—My love of solitude.My love of music, and writing, and dogs.My love of children, my protection of innocence,my desire to help others, even when I come across as misunderstood.He gave me more than I ever realized.And I’m still discovering just how much of him lives on in me.I forgive him.It’s okay.I can see now how hard his life was.And I know he loved me the way he knew how.That’s enough for me."

      "content": "Sometimes things just don’t sit right.You walk away from a moment—an interaction, a conversation, an experience—and something lingers. A question. A discomfort. A subtle sense that something was… off.That happened to me recently.I was asked to come in for another listening interview, despite having already done a full one last week. No one else from my group was asked. My tutor even questioned why I was there. I smiled and said, “I don’t know either—but it’s nice to see you.”But the pairing, the dynamic, the way things were arranged—it stirred something in me. I wondered if I was being tested. If assumptions were being made about me. If I was being placed in a situation to prove something that shouldn’t need proving.Maybe none of that was true. Maybe all of it was. That’s the discomfort of ambiguity—it doesn’t hand you answers. It leaves you with questions. And if you’ve spent most of your life needing to feel safe, needing to understand every dynamic to protect yourself, then ambiguity doesn’t feel neutral. It feels dangerous.But this time, something was different.I didn’t spiral. I didn’t lash out. I didn’t retreat into shame.I just noticed.I noticed the possibility that something felt orchestrated.I noticed how much I wanted clarity.I noticed the old pull to over-analyze—but I didn’t lose myself to it.  And I noticed, too, that I held my integrity throughout.I was kind. I was open. I didn’t project anything unfairly. And I clarified my intention in the moment, without needing days to process. That’s growth. That’s integration.There’s a part of me—the old survival mode—that still scans the environment for hidden meaning. It once kept me safe. And now, I’m learning to use it as a tool, not a trap.I may never know why things unfolded the way they did.But I do know this: I acted in alignment with who I’m becoming.And that’s enough.If you’re someone who also walks away from moments replaying every word, wondering if you misunderstood or were misunderstood—I see you.It’s not easy. But it’s powerful when we can learn to sit with the ambiguity and trust that our body often knows what our mind can’t yet name.Sometimes, the discomfort is the clarity."

Present. Supportive.But I’ve still been questioning them — analyzing their motives, bracing for judgment, assuming threat.And I think I see why now.It’s not because they’ve done anything wrong.It’s because I’ve been projecting my past onto them —because on some level, I sensed they were safe enough to hold it.Which is strangely beautiful, if you think about it.I’ve written in my assignments about my mother, about the difficulty I’ve had trusting women in power.So they probably understand more than I give them credit for.They’ve likely felt my distance, my defensiveness, my internal tug-of-war between wanting connection and pulling away from it.And they’ve stayed present anyway.Not perfect.But steady.And that’s what safety really looks like.But here’s what really stopped me in my tracks:  If I need to project that hard onto someone just to feel safe around them…how could I ever expect a partner to hold that?And I wouldn’t want that for someone I love.Because that kind of mistrust — that need to test, to preempt pain, to stay in control —it doesn’t protect love.It prevents it.So maybe this is the moment.The moment I stop choosing people I know I can’t trust, just so I can stay in charge of the ending.The moment I stop looking for proof of threat and start looking for signs of care.The moment I stop fighting the very thing I’ve always longed for.This doesn’t mean I trust everyone.It doesn’t mean I won’t still feel fear.But it might mean I’m finally learning how to hold that fearwithout letting it hold me back.This might be the moment I finally let someone in."

But there I was, stress levels through the roof, body buzzing like I was under threat, fumbling with screws and wondering why something so minor felt so overwhelming.And then it hit me: maybe I don’t get stressed by these tasks just because they’re unfamiliar. Maybe I’m drawn to them because they feel familiar. Not the tasks themselves — but the dysregulation they bring up. The not-knowing. The self-doubt. The shame of getting it wrong.It’s not that I love the feeling of stress. It’s that part of me is still trying to work something through — something old, something deep.Childhood didn’t give me room to not knowGrowing up, I don’t remember being gently guided through the uncertainty of learning. I don’t remember being told, “It’s okay not to know — let’s figure it out together.”Instead, I remember the heat of being watched, the sting of being mocked, the unspoken message:  “You’re only safe when you’re certain.”So I learned to perform. To hide my vulnerability. To act like I knew what I was doing — even when I didn’t. Especially when I didn’t.And now, even though I’m no longer in that environment, my body still flares up in those familiar moments:  When the drill slips.  When the screw won’t bite.  When I pause, unsure what to do next.That’s when it whispers, Careful. You’re being seen.But here’s what’s different nowThis time, no one is mocking me.No one is trying to keep me small.No one is watching for a weakness to exploit.It’s just me, a curtain rail, and the ghosts of a nervous system that hasn’t yet caught up to the truth.But I’m staying with it. I’m breathing through it.I’m choosing to believe that this moment of not knowing is not a threat.It’s an invitation — to meet myself differently.Words I say to myself now:  “This feels familiar, but it’s not dangerous.”  “No one’s watching me fail. I’m allowed to learn.”  “I am not small — I’m growing.”And maybe, just maybe, every screw I drive is an act of rebellion against the shame that once silenced me.Even if it’s just a curtain rail."

Not from fear.But from the desire to be held in the same way I’ve learned to hold myself.And I’ve come to realise:If someone can’t meet me in the depth I’ve created within,if they can’t hold me better than I already hold myself—then I won’t bring them close.Not as a partner. Not as a friend.Because I’ve worked too hard to meet myself with grace and care.It’s not worth the energy to continually teach someone how to see me,when they’ve never learned how to see themselves.I want love that expands me, not contracts me.I want connection that nourishes, not depletes.And if I settle for less than that, I deny myself the opportunityto be truly met by someone capable of the depth I know exists.It’s a quiet trust now.A trust that maybe I’ll be alone for a long time—maybe forever.But that solitude is still sweeter than the loneliness of being unseen in a relationship.Still sweeter than the slow erosion of my worth through a thousand paper cuts.And when I meet someone who holds themselves the way I’ve learned to hold me—I’ll know.Until then, I will stay sovereign.Because that, too, is love."

      "content": "Today’s session didn’t give me any clear answers.But something opened.We talked about the grief — the slow, heavy grief — of growing up without a mother who loved me in the way I needed.And the absence of a real relationship with my father.Not the kind of absence that’s always physical.But the kind where presence feels unreachable.Where love, if it was there, was buried under shame and silence.I found myself wondering: maybe he did love me.Maybe he just felt like he failed so deeply that he couldn’t face it.So he withdrew, disappeared without physically leaving.I don’t know if that’s true.But I’m letting the question exist without rushing to the answer.We explored family dynamics —My parents.Their parents.My grandparents’ parents.All of it tangled in a web of emotional illiteracy, avoidance, and trauma passed down like an heirloom no one wanted, but everyone carried.It feels like it stops with me.And even though that’s a heavy thing to carry, it’s something I can be proud of.Because the cost of continuing the pattern is greater than the cost of breaking it.At one point, I almost cried.Not about my parents.But about my old therapist — the first person who ever truly held me emotionally.The first person who helped me stay upright when everything inside me was collapsing.The first person who gave me a glimpse of what it might feel like to be… loved.Before them, I don’t think I had ever been loved in a way that didn’t carry conditions or confusion.And that hit me today in a way that felt surprisingly tender.I also found myself saying things I hadn’t quite put together before:  “I’ve never really understood why my parents stayed together.”  “Maybe my dad stayed to protect me. I don’t know.”And maybe I’ll never really know.Maybe that part isn’t mine to understand.But what is mine is this:To give my son the life I didn’t have.Not in a performative, overcompensating way —but from a place of quiet strength.A place where love is felt, not just assumed.Where presence is chosen, not avoided.Where grief isn’t hidden, but honored.So no — today didn’t bring tidy insight.No breakthroughs. No clean arc of resolution.Just a doorway.And that’s enough.Because some therapy sessions don’t have answers —They just offer openings.And that’s where healing begins."

Don’t let them all the way in. Don’t be fooled.”That voice used to keep me safe.Now, it keeps me alone.Removing that last line of defense doesn’t mean trusting blindly.It means trusting with discernment.It means realizing that some people are different.That some people mean well — and deserve to be trusted until proven otherwise, not the other way around.This shift won’t happen overnight.But every time I pause before assuming threat,every time I breathe instead of building armor,every time I soften……I’m telling my body a new story.And maybe this time, I don’t need defending."

He’s only with me for the weekend, and school starts Monday. I don’t need to overdo it. I just need to get what will help us both feel okay.That’s enough.What’s different this time is that I’m not trying to hide how I feel from him.I plan to be honest with him.To say:  “My energy’s a little low today — I’ve been doing a lot on my own. But I love you. And I’m glad you’re here. I just might need a little more space, a few more walks, some quieter moments.”I trust that he can handle that.And if it’s too much for him — if something doesn’t land quite right — then we’ll talk.We’ll find a rhythm that honours both our needs, without guilt on either side.That’s the part I used to miss:The belief that we could work it out together, without me abandoning myself to keep him happy.This shift feels big.It’s not just about parenting.It’s about how I show up with my students.With friends.With myself.It’s the decision to stop performing wellness.To stop pretending I’m full when I’m running on half.And to still show up — fully honest, even if not fully energised.I don’t know yet whether my ex will reply.But I do know that if she doesn’t, I can handle it.I might not be at my best.But I’ll be real.And sometimes, that’s even better.Because the greatest gift I can offer my son — and my students — is not perfection.It’s presence.And today, I can offer that."

But for me, it is.And it put into sharp focus just how incapable my mother has been —how little respect she has ever shown me,and how much that absence has shaped the way I’ve learned to tolerate pain.This doesn’t mean I want anything more with my ex.We don’t work together.We both carry wounds that trigger each other in ways that are too complex, too corrosive, too costly — especially for our son.Even now, after all the work I’ve done, too much time with her could unravel it.Not because I haven’t healed,but because I’ve worked too hard to climb out of that dynamic to ever willingly step back in.And so I’m learning this:  Respect is a minimum.Safety is something deeper.Respect might look like a kind message.But safety is about how I feel after — whether I still feel grounded, calm, whole.Whether I’m still me.Today, I held the line.I acknowledged the respect without reopening the door.And I recognised that I don’t need to turn small moments of decency into invitations for reconnection.I’ve learned to see things clearly now.And I’m not trading that clarity for anything — not even a flicker of familiarity.Not everything that’s respectful is safe.And I choose safety now.For me.For my son.For the man I’ve become."

They’re here to assess.”But something in me is softening now.Maybe there was an admin reason.Maybe it was just protocol.But maybe — also — she cared.Maybe she’s read my assignments.Maybe she’s seen my journey.Maybe she picked up on something in my energy, something in my writing, and just wanted to make sure I was okay.And maybe… I can let that in.Not all the way. Not instantly.But a little.  Maybe I could welcome her in.That sentence doesn’t come easy.It carries the weight of so many times I let people in and got hurt.So many times I trusted too soon, and it cost me.But this feels different.There’s no pressure. No demand.Just a quiet possibility:That someone might have cared — not because I earned it, but because I’m human.That’s still hard for me to sit with.Because when you grow up expecting judgment, even care can feel like a trick.But this time… I don’t think it is.And maybe — just maybe — this is what it feels like to be cared for."

That… might be the deepest form of care I’ve ever received.She wears a strong exterior.Sometimes sharp. Sometimes closed.But today, I saw the little girl in her — the one who still looks out for people.I saw the strength she had to become,and the softness she’s never fully let go of.I respect her deeply.And more than that — I appreciate her.This didn’t erase my wounds.But it softened them.It reminded me that not everyone wants something from me.That some people just see, and stay.And today, for the first time in a long time, I let someone in.Maybe this is what care really looks like.And maybe… I’m ready to receive it."

Is this choice expanding me,or shrinking me?  Is it love—or fear?That single question has become the greatest teacher in my life.Not a rulebook.Not a doctrine.But a compass.A quiet check-in with the part of me that already knows the way.And more often now, I choose love.Not because it’s easier, but because it’s me."

It’s a survival role.For a long time, I thought that if I stopped being useful, I’d be forgotten.That if I stopped showing up for everyone else, no one would show up for me.So I gave. And gave. And gave.Until there was nothing left of me.Leaving the roles behind doesn’t mean becoming selfish.It means becoming whole.It means asking questions I used to avoid:  What do I need?  What does reciprocity feel like?  What happens when I stop performing and start existing?It means noticing when I’m about to say “yes” out of habit — and pausing instead.It means letting the silence stretch.It means walking away from relationships that only value me when I’m useful.And yes, it’s lonely sometimes.Because when you stop playing the role, some people disappear.But I’m learning not to chase after those people anymore.Because if my presence depends on my usefulness, then I was never really seen to begin with.So here’s where I am now:  I’m no longer available for one-sided relationships.I’m no longer interested in being the unpaid therapist.I’m no longer building bridges that only I walk across.This isn’t anger. It’s clarity.This isn’t bitterness. It’s healing.And it’s the first step toward connection that’s real —where I am not a role, but a person.Where I am not needed — but loved."

That he didn’t care because he wasn’t there.But maybe that wasn’t the full story.Maybe it wasn’t even close.Because when I really reflect — when I let the noise settle and I listen for what was real beneath the surface — I remember the way he introduced me to art, to music, to films. I remember his love for football and how he tried to share it with me. I remember the chocolate — maybe too much of it — and the decent meals he made sure I had. I remember him teaching me the basics of cooking, of self-care, of getting by.And I remember the way he tried to discipline me.Tried to teach me how to think for myself.Tried to get through — even if he shouted, even if it missed the mark.He told me he shouted to make me think.It didn’t work. But maybe his intention wasn’t to harm.Maybe it was to help, in the only way he knew how.And now?Now I sit with something I didn’t think I’d feel.  I forgive him.It’s okay, man.You loved me the way you knew how.And I don’t hold anything against you.Because I see it now — the impossible situation he was in.How maybe he stayed in a relationship that drained him because it was the only way to be near us.How maybe he thought if he left, he’d lose all contact with me.How maybe he saw what kind of woman my mother was and felt ashamed — ashamed for bringing a child into that system and not knowing how to fix it.He stayed.He endured.And maybe, in his own way, he protected me from the worst of it.That reflection changes things.It changes how I show up for my son.It changes what I carry forward, and what I choose to lay down.I want to be present.I want to model a healthy relationship — even if that means leaving one that isn’t.I want to set boundaries that allow me to give more, not less.I want to love my son for who he is — not who I wish he was.And I want to give him what my dad couldn’t give me clearly: safety, consistency, and full emotional presence.But maybe the most healing realization?My dad wasn’t the villain.He"

Maybe it’s emotional immaturity.Maybe she’s been so disconnected from her own truth that she’ll never know how to hold mine.But whatever it is, I’m done circling it, naming it, trying to understand it.Because I understand this:  Her presence is not safe.Her messages are not neutral.Her love is not love.There was a time when I thought standing up to her would destroy me.That setting a boundary would invite punishment, chaos, or guilt I couldn’t survive.But when I finally said no — when I drew the line and meant it —nothing happened.No explosion. No backlash. No storm.Just… silence.And in that silence, I felt peace.  I thought this would break me.But it set me free.I see now that her power over me was never real.It was a residue of childhood — of needing her love to survive.But I’m not surviving anymore.I’m living.So yes — for me, she is dead.And I’m finally alive.Not bitter.Not cold.Just clear.And that’s enough."

Here’s what I really went through.”And for a long time, I thought that fear meant something was wrong with me.But I see it differently now.My fear of being seen was rooted in reason.Because when I was young, being seen meant being picked apart.Being mocked. Dismissed. Shamed.It meant being exposed in my vulnerability — and then left there, alone.So of course I hid. Of course I kept things to myself. Of course I made my inner world invisible.It was the safest thing I could do.But that reason doesn’t exist anymore.I’m not a child. I’m not trapped in that house. I’m not waiting for scraps of love from people who withhold it like punishment.And suddenly, something clicked:  By refusing to be seen — by silencing the truth of my story — I’ve been protecting people who never loved me. And never will.And… why?Why am I protecting them?Why am I shielding their reputations with my silence?Why am I softening my truth to avoid upsetting the very people who let me suffer? Why am I still trying to keep them comfortable while I carry the discomfort?And then, of course, another voice rises in me.That old, cutting voice. The one that says:  “Who even cares?You sound like a whiny little child.Why are you still talking about this?”And for a second, I almost listen.Because that voice is familiar — it was the background noise of my childhood.But I pause. I breathe.And I remember:  That “whiny little child” was just a child in pain.A child who needed to be held, not silenced.A child who was made to feel like needing love was a flaw.So no — I’m not whining.I’m witnessing.I’m making space for the story I was never allowed to tell.And if it makes someone uncomfortable, they’re free to look away. I’m not writing for them.I’m writing for the child in me who still aches to be believed.I’m writing for my son, so that he’ll grow up never doubting that his emotions are valid.I’m writing for anyone else who’s still holding their breath, waiting for permission to speak.You have permission.And so do I.I’m done protecting the people who couldn’t love me.That job is over now."

Real kindness opens doors.It doesn’t close them behind you.I’ve started to notice when something feels off—when my body tenses even as someone offers help,when the “yes” I’m giving is soaked in guilt,when I feel less free after being “cared for.”These are signs.They’re not overreactions.They’re wisdom.And I’m learning that it’s okay to walk away from kindness that’s really control.Even if it’s subtle.Even if it’s “nice.”Even if everyone else praises it.Because I’ve learned that the most radical thing I can dois to trust my gut—and choose the version of love that lets me breathe.If any part of this resonates, know this:You don’t have to keep betraying yourself just to be polite.You’re allowed to name it.You’re allowed to leave."

Sabotaged the good to stay small. Because I was taught—consciously or not—that being fully me was dangerous. That autonomy was selfish. That success was threatening.But now, I see through that.They didn’t demonize poker because it was harmful.They demonized it because it represented freedom. My freedom.And free people can’t be controlled.That’s what poker has become for me—a mirror.A proving ground.A reclamation.I reflect on my decisions now, not to shame myself, but to refine. I made a marginal call with pocket fours today—probably too wide. But it wasn’t reckless. It wasn’t emotional. It was thoughtful. Exploratory. Strategic. And while I lost the hand, I didn’t lose myself. That’s growth.I watch other players make clear mistakes—players with results, with reputations—and I realize, I’m not behind. I’m not lacking. I’m right here, right now, walking my own path with clarity and increasing calm. I don’t need to sabotage it anymore to keep anyone close. I’ve already faced my deepest grief. And what came after… was me.I’m going to play poker for the rest of my life—not because I have to, not because it defines me, but because I choose it. It aligns. It sharpens. It frees.And the truth is, I’m already a beast.In a year? I’ll be undeniable.But even if I never win another tournament, I’ve already won something far greater:I’ve stopped making myself small for the sake of someone else’s comfort.And for the first time, I trust myself to keep growing."

      "content": "It’s been eight years since my dad died.I don’t even know the exact date. That says a lot, I think.Growing up, the version of him I was left with was one painted by my mum—a man who was angry, resentful, and sad.And to be honest, some of that was true.He hurt me. Physically. Emotionally. He embarrassed me in front of others. He didn’t protect me in moments I needed protecting. That’s real.But it’s not the whole story. Not anymore.There were flashes in him—moments of joy that I never saw in my mum. He came alive around the dogs. He had a peace about him when he was watching films. He took pride in telling terrible jokes—really terrible ones—the kind that made everyone groan, but you could tell how much he loved them. He’d light up in those moments like a child being seen. And somehow, those jokes were him—playful, awkward, a little out of step, but unmistakably proud.He also loved chess and Scrabble. He kept himself busy. Structured. He had a routine that gave his days rhythm. It wasn’t a life filled with rich relationships or deep emotional connection—but it was a life he managed to make work. It looked a lot like survival. But there was some joy in that survival. A kind of quiet resilience.And that, too, lives on in me.Especially the music. He loved music deeply. And I find myself playing the kind of music he loved when I’m just doing life—decorating, walking through the house. It keeps something alive. It keeps him alive, in some way.At his funeral, I cried. Probably the only one who did.And people told me not to. Told me I shouldn’t.But I wasn’t crying for what we had.I was crying for what we never had.That’s the grief I still carry—the absence of connection. The conversations we never had. The man I never got to know. The dad I always wished he could’ve been.I used to see him as weak for staying with Mum. Now I wonder if he was just stuck—worn down by her control, knowing that no matter what he did, she’d always win. Maybe he saw how she used me to meet her needs. Maybe he knew that trying to pull me away would only backfire. I wonder if that’s why he told me to “go off with your mother” so many times. Because he knew she’d always have the upper hand.And I wonder—what were his options? What could he have done, really, if he did have my best interest at heart?He didn’t leave, and part of me used to hate him for that.But maybe staying was his way of not losing me altogether.I wish we’d had a chance to talk as adults.I think I’d understand him more.I’m not excusing the pain. But I’m also not pretending he was just one thing.He was messy. Human. He was hurting. And still—he found ways to laugh, to structure his days, to survive. That alone is more than I can say for some people. My mum, for example—I’m not sure I’ve ever seen her experience joy.He did. And I think he tried to hold onto it, in the only ways he knew how.I carry some of that with me now. The good parts.And maybe, just maybe—that’s a kind of connection too.If you’ve lost someone you never really had a chance to know, you’re not alone. Grieving the absence—the “what could’ve been”—is just as real. And sometimes, the act of remembering with compassion is the first step toward healing."

      "content": "What happens now?That question used to terrify me. But now… it just is. Like Noel Gallagher sang, “I’m free to be whatever I, whatever I choose.” And for once, I believe it.The past was packed with obligation—some real, some imagined. The weight of being what others needed, what they expected, what made them comfortable. And now, that weight is gone. The expectations have evaporated. The role-playing has ended. What’s left is something unfamiliar, but somehow—mine.I’m not here to serve anyone else’s story anymore. Not my mother’s. Not a partner’s. Not a broken culture that thrives on performance and self-denial. The only relationship that remains untouched by obligation is the one with my son. And even that… it isn’t something I have to do. It’s something I get to do. It’s love. Not duty.Everything else? If it doesn’t align with who I am now, I’m not making space for it. My time is precious. My energy is sacred. And yet, here comes the real question, the one that echoes after the storm:What now?Will the uncertainty return? Will fear creep back in through the cracks? Or have I truly met the darkest parts of myself—and made peace?The truth is, I don’t know.Maybe this is the space after.The void that opens once the scaffolding of an old identity has been dismantled.The quiet field after the fire has burned everything false to the ground.But freedom isn’t always easy. Sometimes, it’s disorienting. And sometimes, it whispers things I’m not sure I’m ready to hear:“You’re no longer who you were. So… who are you now?”Maybe I don’t need to answer that today.Maybe, for now, it’s enough to just feel this freedom.To let it settle into my bones, and trust that something new will rise—not from fear or obligation, but from something much deeper.Love. Truth. Choice.I’m not free because I’ve escaped something.I’m free because I’ve finally chosen to stay.Here.With myself."

      "content": "I’ve noticed something.When I speak honestly about my ability to be alone—not lonely, but truly at peace in my own company—some people get uncomfortable.Even seasoned therapists. Even people with spiritual practices or long-term relationships. They hesitate. They question. Some even hint that it’s unhealthy.And I wonder… why?I think, sometimes, it’s because they know—deep down—that they’ve stayed in relationships or dynamics they shouldn’t have.Not because they were good. But because they were afraid to be alone.So when someone like me says, “I chose solitude, and it’s been one of the most healing things I’ve ever done,”what it stirs up isn’t doubt about me—it’s doubt about them.But rather than face that doubt, it’s easier to turn the mirror outward.To question my mental health.To quietly wonder if my past psychosis means I might still be deluded.To think: “No one who is truly well could be this okay being alone.”But that’s projection.Or at least, part of it is.And I’m not immune to that either.Maybe I’m projecting something too—some unconscious expectation that people will always misread me, always doubt me, always look for the cracks.But the truth is likely somewhere in between.Yes, people project their fear of solitude onto me.And yes, I sometimes brace for judgment because of my past.But here’s what I know now:  My ability to be alone is not a red flag. It’s a reflection of my freedom.It’s the result of hard work, self-inquiry, and choosing to let go of relationships that didn’t nourish me—even when that meant facing the ache of emptiness.And not everyone is ready for that kind of freedom.Because true solitude doesn’t just bring peace. It brings up everything you’ve been avoiding.So when others squirm in response to my stillness, I don’t need to shrink or explain.I can just remind myself:  This isn’t about me being unwell.It’s about me being unwilling to live untrue.Some people stay in noise because silence scares them.I stayed in silence until it became sacred.That doesn’t make me broken.That makes me whole."

Not to prove anything. Just because… I’m allowed to.And it was surreal.Not because it was wild or intense, but because it was real.I’ve spent so many years disconnected from my body.Even when I was in great shape, I never let myself see my own beauty.Never appreciated how good it feels to be in my skin, as I am.To say out loud, even now:I have a beautiful body. I’m a beautiful human. I’m sexual. I’m primal. I’m sensual.And saying that still feels strange—but it also feels freeing.I’m not trying to master my sexuality. I’m just meeting it.And honestly? I like who I’m meeting.What’s scarier is the thought of sharing that with someone one day.Letting them know that I’m still discovering this part of me.That I’ve never really explored my sensuality with another person.That I’m a bit naive in that way—but also open, curious, excited.And maybe that’s what real intimacy looks like:Not being polished, but being present.Not knowing everything, but wanting to discover it together.This moment wasn’t about climax.It was about not abandoning myself.And I didn’t.For the first time, I felt what it means to be with myself—completely."

The one who listens, supports, responds… and gets nothing back. He’s not unkind. But he doesn’t see me. He doesn’t check in. He disappears when I’m struggling. And when he returns, it’s often when he needs soothing.And I’ve run out of energy for that.What’s painful isn’t the end of this one relationship—it’s the pattern it represents. A pattern I’ve repeated too many times. Where I stay. Where I give. Where I let myself be hidden. Where my fear of being truly seen is safe, because the other person isn’t looking.It’s hard to let go.There are pangs of guilt.He’s probably lonely.But I’ve been lonely too.And he’s never helped me up when I was down.That’s the truth I couldn’t unsee anymore.We only get so much time in this life. So much energy. And I want to spend mine on relationships that are mutual. Where I am met. Where I am seen. Where I don’t have to shrink into a role just to stay connected.This isn’t about anger.

You’ll fall behind.”And for a while, I listened.I believed that voice.I thought it was drive. Hunger. Ambition. Potential.But now, I’m starting to see it differently.That voice might not be ambition.It might be survival.It’s the younger version of me—still carrying the fear that if I don’t keep pushing, I’ll lose everything. That I’ll fail. That I’ll never prove I was good enough.Poker gave me something concrete to hold onto. It offered agency in a world where I often felt powerless. And to be fair—it served me when I needed it.But I’m not in that place anymore.I’ve poked my head above the trenches. And I’m realizing something simple but important:I’m already free.There’s no one coming to take this away.The money I’ve received is mine.I don’t have to prove myself to keep it.I don’t have to perform to stay safe.And yet… part of me still wants to prove something.Part of me says:“If I just put in more hours, I’ll finally prove I’m profitable.”“I’ll validate this whole journey. I’ll be vindicated.”But when I sit with that, I realize:That’s not my adult voice speaking.That’s the adapted, rebellious part of me—the one shaped by childhood wounds, always looking to earn love, to get the final say, to win.It’s not balanced.It’s not free.That part of me doesn’t need shame.It needs care.This is where my nurturing, fathering energy can step in—the part of me I’m learning to embody.To say gently:  “You’ve already proven you’re good at poker.You’ve already shown you can do hard things.But you don’t need to play from pressure.You don’t need to prove anything to be valid.You’re loved. You’re accepted.Maybe just by yourself, at first—but that’s enough.”Poker doesn’t define me.And neither does validation.Each day now, I ask myself:  Am I playing from freedom—or fear?Am I resting from love—or guilt?Because freedom isn’t about how much I do.It’s about remembering that I don’t have to do anything to earn being okay."

She couldn’t be part of it. She couldn’t offer fake help or passive-aggressive sabotage disguised as support.It scared her.And so, she made it feel like I was doing something wrong.That every win was abandonment.That every independent step was selfish, dangerous, immoral.And the worst part?It worked.I internalised it.So I sabotaged everything.Not because I was weak.But because it was the only power I had left.If being successful meant being owned, I’d rather destroy it all.It was my last act of rebellion.The only form of control I had left.How fucked up is that?But now I see it.I didn’t ruin things because I didn’t care.I ruined them because I cared too much — and I didn’t know how to separate my worth from her grip.Now I do.Now I know I can succeed and still be mine.I can win a tournament and not feel like I’m betraying someone.I can do well in life without needing her blessing — or fearing her resentment.I’m not sabotaging anymore.I’m living.And this time, I get to own it."

      "content": "What if I wasn’t bipolar?What if everything I ever did — the spirals, the high energy, the crashes, the breakdowns — was a completely rational response to the most demonic, soul-erasing emotional abuse a child could endure?Because now I see it clearly:I wasn’t mentally ill.I was unloved.I was unheld.I was raised in an emotional vacuum, where the absence of care was so absolute, so persistent, that my nervous system simply broke trying to fill the void.And no one saw it.They saw the symptoms.The erratic moments.The fear, the fire, the shutdowns, the disconnection.So they gave it a name: bipolar.But what they never saw was the cause.I know now that I was not broken.I was reacting — fiercely, desperately — to a childhood no one should have to survive.There are children in war zones, in poverty, in so-called third world countries, who were held, attuned to, loved — and as a result, their nervous systems were intact.Mine never had a chance.Not one person said “I love you.”Not one person protected me.Not one person regulated with me.Not one person saw me as a child who needed care.And that’s what breaks a person.Not genetics.Not chemical imbalance.Neglect.So what if I wasn’t bipolar?What if that label was just another way of missing the point — of silencing my pain, pathologising my truth, and making me the problem?Because I see now — I wasn’t disordered.I was abused.And I survived it without a single hand to hold.That’s not an illness.That’s resilience.And I will never again let anyone name my survival as sickness.I know what happened to me.And I know who I am now.Whole.Worthy.Awake.Alive."

      "content": "I think one of the hardest things to admit is how deeply I was used.After I left hospital, vulnerable and trying to rebuild my life, I had some work done on the house. My mother suggested someone to do the bathroom, but they didn’t call back. So I chose someone else — my friend’s dad. He was kind, affordable, and did nothing wrong.But she couldn’t handle that.That I made a decision without her.That I trusted someone other than her.That I didn’t need her.So she began picking him apart — his work, his reliability, his integrity. And eventually, he left the job. I didn’t understand why at the time, but now I do: he saw her for what she was, and wanted no part in it.And then came the next step:Taking him to court.Not because it was right. Not because I believed he deserved it. But because she said it was the right thing to do. And I was still so lost. I’d just come out of hospital, I was trying to be a father, open a shop, get my footing again. So I let her lead.I even delivered the court letter to his house myself.And I’ve carried the shame of that moment for years.But the shame doesn’t belong to me.It belongs to the woman who used me — her own son — as a weapon to preserve her ego.She made me betray my values in the name of loyalty.She made me feel like I was protecting something noble, when really I was defending her image at the cost of my integrity.And worse, she enjoyed it. She enjoyed seeing me vulnerable, compliant, in her grip.That’s not love. That’s something else. Something far more disturbing.And I see now that she’s probably the biggest reason I went psychotic.She never nurtured me. She only managed me.And in the moment I needed care the most — when I was trying to rise from rock bottom — she made herself the centre of my story again.She visited me every day in hospital. And I used to think that meant something.But now, I realise she was there to keep me sick.Because a sick son is a controllable son.Because as long as I was dependent, she had a purpose.Because she couldn’t handle the version of me that might live freely, truthfully, without her.It’s no wonder I find it hard to trust.It’s no wonder I project my unmet inner child onto others.It’s no wonder I’ve spent decades trying to figure out what’s wrong with me — when what’s “wrong” was what I had to become to survive her.I didn’t deserve that.No child does.And if this post sounds like hate, that’s because some things deserve to be hated.What she did wasn’t just a mistake.It was a pattern. A legacy. A form of slow destruction wrapped in maternal performance.And I’m done carrying the guilt for that.I’m done protecting her reputation at the cost of my healing.I see it now.I was used.But I’m not hers anymore."

      "date": "June 04, 2025",
      "content": "Sometimes, poker doesn’t punish bad decisions.Sometimes, it punishes good ones.We were six-handed in an $88 tournament. I had 40 big blinds in the small blind. The button min-raised, and I flatted with pocket nines.Now, the big blind — sitting on a 10 big blind stack — shoved all in.It folded back to the button, and he reshoved. All in. Forty bigs.Now here’s where the spot gets interesting.I’d underrepresented my hand by just calling preflop. From the button’s perspective, I likely looked capped — maybe like I had a weak suited ace, some middling connectors, or a hand I didn’t want to 3-bet. And so, when the BB jams for 10BB, the button has every reason to isolate wide. I think his range includes:Small pairs (22–88)Broadways like ATo+, AJo+, KQoSuited aces and connectorsAnd of course, value hands — TT+In other words, his iso-jam range is wide.So I called with 99, thinking I’m ahead of most of that.And I was.The big blind had pocket eights.The board ran out 8-9-10.Flopped middle set. But it didn’t hold.It’s easy to feel stupid after a hand like that. Easy to doubt myself.But when I step back and take emotion out of it — the analysis holds.Flatting pre with 99 isn’t wrong. It’s balanced.BB’s 10BB shove is standard.Button’s iso range should be wide given my perceived weakness.Calling with 99 against that range is profitable.I made the right call.It just didn’t work out this time.That’s the hardest part of poker — separating decision quality from outcome.But it’s also the most important.This hand didn’t teach me that I misplayed.It taught me that I’m learning to trust myself, even when the board doesn’t go my way.Because sometimes good decisions still hurt.And that’s okay."

It’s better than anything else I’ve known.But I’d love to love someone.And be loved in return.To build something gentle, honest, and whole.And I think I’m finally ready to stop projecting.To stop chasing my mother’s ghost in the women around me.To see clearly.To connect deeply.To be in relationship not from lack, but from presence.This feels like the turning point.The part of the story where I don’t need to discover more horror.Where the truth has landed and there’s nothing left to fear.Where I can finally feel love stirring in me, and not be afraid of what that means.This is the beginning of life.Of real peace.Of the future I was always meant to live.And I am ready."

      "content": "There’s something oddly comforting about women who are unavailable.Maybe they’re married. Maybe they’re distant. Maybe they’ve made it clear — they’re not interested.And yet, somehow, that’s where I’ve felt most able to be… me.Because there’s no risk of intimacy when intimacy is off the table.No threat of being fully seen, only to be fully rejected.No possibility of things going somewhere, which means no chance of them falling apart.That’s not manipulative. That’s a nervous system seeking safety.And it’s only now that I’m starting to understand it — not judge it.I’ve felt attraction to women I can’t have, and I’ve also felt shame about it.But when I sit with that shame — when I ask what’s really underneath — I don’t find bad intentions.I find unmet needs.A desire to feel wanted.A longing to be seen, but only from a safe distance.A craving for connection without the risk of abandonment.There’s a younger part of me in all of this.The boy who grew up being hurt by closeness.The one who learned that love wasn’t safe, and that wanting something — especially someone — often led to pain.That part of me doesn’t need to be fixed.He needs to be listened to.He needs to know he’s not dirty or shameful for wanting to feel something, even if it’s been misdirected.I want to change this pattern — not because desiring someone is wrong — but because I want to stop running from real intimacy.I want to desire women who can meet me where I’m at.I want to be seen — not just glimpsed from afar.And maybe the first step is letting myself be seen… by me.Even in the places that feel a bit messy.Even in the places where shame whispers that I’m too much.Maybe especially there."

And it stirred something. That small ache of aloneness. Not dramatic. Just a shift. Enough for my nervous system to say, You’re alone again. Time to get busy.But I wasn’t alone. I was with me.And maybe that’s the real work now.Not pushing through.Not fixing myself.Just being with myself — especially in those quiet moments when there’s “nothing” to do.Because that’s when I’m learning:I am not what I produce.I don’t have to earn rest.I don’t have to do to be enough.Sometimes the bravest thing I can do is simply… be here."

      "content": "I’ve just realised something hard to admit, but freeing.There was a friendship in my life — one that lasted over 15 years — that I think was never truly equal. It was likely held together by something that looked like care, but wasn’t really connection.The other person had lost people to suicide. I think they might have felt good — even righteous — about helping someone like me. Maybe they saw me as someone fragile, someone to protect. And at times, I was fragile.But I wasn’t on their level. Not in their eyes. And deep down, I think I knew that.And I accepted it.Because I wanted to be looked after. I was drawn to people who would take that role — people who made me feel safe, even if it meant being the one always a little bit behind, always a little less.Looking back now, I see how human that was. I needed safety. I needed someone. But I also see how that dynamic — when sustained over years — kept me small. It might not have been intentional on their part, but when someone is always “helping” you, there’s a subtle imbalance of power that develops. One that can be hard to escape.And I’ve resented people for that.Still do, if I’m honest.But I also see now — that resentment isn’t the whole story.Because I played a part too.Not in creating the dynamic — but in maintaining it.I didn’t know better. But now I do.This in-between period I’m in?This space without the old friends, without the distractions, without the illusion of safety?It’s been necessary. Painfully, quietly, beautifully necessary.Because I could have gone through life continuing the same cycles. And on the surface, everything would have looked fine.But I would have never met myself.Never claimed my full weight in the world.Never stepped into the kind of relationship where I could stand equal — not pitied, not rescued, not admired — just seen.And that is my birthright.To be whole.To be loved without hierarchy.To be a friend, not a project."

      "content": "There’s a part of me I don’t often talk about.The part that longs to be desired — not just liked, not just accepted — but truly wanted. The kind of desire that doesn’t just tolerate your presence but lights up at the sight of you. That leans in. That lingers.For a long time, I told myself I didn’t need that. That I was above it, or beyond it, or better off without it. But that wasn’t the truth. That was the survival story I had to write when I wasn’t being mirrored back as worthy. When desire felt unsafe. When I associated wanting with rejection.So I suppressed it.And in its place, I became “nice.”I became “safe.”I became someone who could never be rejected — but also, someone who rarely got to be fully seen.Recently, I’ve started to realise that this part of me — the part that wants to feel wanted — isn’t weak. It’s not shameful. It’s not manipulative or selfish.It’s sacred.It’s the part of me that still believes intimacy could be mutual. That someone could see me — truly see me — and not flinch. That desire could exist without danger. That I wouldn’t be abandoned for being too much, or shamed for being vulnerable, or punished for being real.That feels like healing.And yes, it’s scary.Yes, I still feel the echoes of old wounds.But I’m starting to notice: the more I allow myself to feel that desire — without judgment — the more human I feel. The more whole I feel.This isn’t about rushing into connection. It’s not about needing someone to fill a gap. It’s about reclaiming a part of myself I once buried to survive.I want to be desired.And that’s okay.Maybe you do too.And maybe it’s time we stop pretending otherwise.Sometimes the most radical thing we can do is admit we want to be wanted — and then, lovingly, want ourselves first."

      "content": "I’ve started to see a pattern that has run through most of my relationships.At some level, I think I’ve been searching for a part of myself in other people — the part that was never fully met in childhood. The nurturing parent. The one who sees me gently, holds space, offers warmth without judgment.But instead of that, I often ended up with the critical parent — the voice that judges, corrects, stands one step above.And I took the one-down position.Again and again.It’s not always obvious.Sometimes the relationship even feels healthy on the surface.But when I look closely, the dynamic is still there — that sense that I’m the one being helped, tolerated, subtly managed.And the truth is…On some level, I wanted that.Not the criticism, but the care. The containment. The feeling that someone could finally give me what I missed.Of course I looked for it in others.Of course I kept ending up in uneven dynamics.Because I’d never known what it felt like to be held without hierarchy.For a long time, I denied how bad my childhood really was.How little attunement there was.How unskilled my parents were at parenting.And because I couldn’t face that, I internalised all the shame of it.I believed it was me. That I was too much. Too sensitive. Too needy.But it wasn’t me.The shame didn’t start in me. It was passed to me — by parents who couldn’t meet my needs, and then made me feel wrong for having them.And I’ve been carrying that shame into relationships ever since.But now I see it.I’m not broken for wanting to be nurtured.I’m not weak for needing softness.I’m just someone who never received it — and now knows how to name that wound.And that changes everything.Because if I can be conscious of the pattern, I don’t have to keep repeating it.And if I can meet myself with compassion, I won’t need others to hold what I’m not willing to hold within.I don’t need saving.I don’t need fixing.I just need truth. And care. And the kind of love that starts from within.And that… I can give myself now."

But in action. In stillness. In how I choose to respond when I feel overwhelmed or alone.I’ve made mistakes in the past — picked people who activated my wounds instead of helping them heal.People who felt like the nurturing parent I never had, but who turned out to be the critical voice I’ve spent my life trying to quiet.And I see now — I was caught in the drama triangle:Victim. Rescuer. Persecutor.Switching roles. Staying stuck. Always dysregulated.But today, I’m stepping out of the triangle.I’m choosing presence over performance.And that, in itself, is healing.So I’m taking it slow.Not because I’ve lost faith in life.But because I’ve finally started to trust it."

Easier to manipulate. Easier to keep under her thumb.That is not love. That is possession.She didn’t want children. She admitted that, laughed it off like it was funny. Like my very existence was a joke. And yet, somehow, she still thinks she’s entitled to my time, my energy, my loyalty — after everything.She’s not.Every time I revisit this, I feel the hate rise up again.And yeah — I hate her.That’s just the truth of it.It’s not graceful. It’s not poetic.But it’s honest.I spent decades trying to protect her image — in my mind, in the world, even in my own healing. But the more I see her clearly, the more I understand just how damaging she was. How much of my soul she tried to own. How many parts of myself I had to bury just to survive.And now?I’m angry.I’m done.And I don’t need to censor that anymore.Letting this out isn’t staying stuck. It’s releasing.It’s unhooking myself from the shame and the silence.It’s saying:  “I didn’t deserve that. I was never the problem. She was.”And if I circle back to this again, that’s okay.Because it wasn’t one wound — it was a thousand small cuts over decades.This is me healing.This is me reclaiming.And this is me saying — finally —Fuck her."

Most of my life has been shaped by the need to control. To manage. To preempt. I’ve never really had someone model what it looks like to trust the process. It was always about survival, never surrender.It was always out of fear.But I’m starting to ease into a different kind of framework.What if it could come from love?What if I could trust the process — not out of naivety or false optimism, but because I finally believe that the life I want doesn’t have to be forced into place?That maybe the most fruitful things in life grow slowly. Quietly.Only when given space.It’s still hard.Letting things naturally arise. Not rushing into conversations, relationships, or plans just to fill a gap. Not gripping onto meaning in every moment.But I’m learning that trying to force life to bend to my timeline has only kept me from noticing the life already trying to meet me.There’s something deeper available in the waiting.A freedom I’ve never really known.And maybe, if I keep choosing this —If I allow things to unfold without control —The people who are meant to walk with me will find me.Naturally.Without force.Without pretending.Without me having to exhaust myself to earn it.Just me, showing up — open, rooted, and finally letting life come to me."

Like an old bruise that flinches when pressed.Sometimes I feel them when I’m alone.Sometimes in the presence of people who are kind but distant.And sometimes they sneak up on me in the form of jealousy, resentment, fantasy, or deep fatigue.They’re unmet needs.Not because I’m needy. But because I’m human.And instead of trying to get rid of them or rationalise them away, I’m starting to ask a different question:What if I could sit with them?What if I could let the ache be felt, without having to fix it?What if I could hold it like I would a child — mine — who just needs to be heard?No silencing.No rushing.No “you should be over this by now.”Just presence.Because unmet needs don’t disappear when ignored. They morph. They disguise themselves as perfectionism, addictions, people-pleasing, isolation.But when met with compassion — when seen — they begin to soften.And sometimes, they begin to speak.  “I wanted to be protected.”“I wanted to be chosen.”“I wanted to matter.”“I wanted someone to notice when I was hurting.”They’re not asking for magic. They’re asking for you.Your adult self. The part of you that knows better now. The part that’s slowly learning how to reparent the one who was once left alone with too much pain and too little support.And you don’t have to solve it all at once.You just have to stay.Sit with the need.Let it breathe.Let it exist.Let it know it doesn’t have to scream anymore to be heard.Because when you stop abandoning your own unmet needs, the world becomes a safer place — not because it’s changed, but because you have.Presence is the medicine. Listening is the beginning. You are not too much — you were just too alone."

Instead, I’ve filled it with food, porn, or moments of fleeting closeness — anything to ease the ache that I’ve been taught to feel shame about. But there’s no shame in wanting connection. There never was.I used to think I couldn’t meet that need without someone else. But I’m starting to understand myself differently now. I can hold myself. I can ask what that part of me needs. And sometimes, it’s as simple as hugging my dog. She just is. She doesn’t ask me to be anyone else. She wants to be close. And honestly, my body doesn’t know the difference — in those moments, I am held.Still, I’d love to be held by a human being. Not just sexually — though I’m not ashamed of wanting that too — but emotionally, deeply. I want to be seen, accepted, and met. And I realise now that I was getting some of that at college, especially on Wednesdays. Those days gave me emotional nourishment, moments of real connection. Now that college has ended, I feel the gap.I see it now — that’s why the girl from college meant something to me. I felt emotionally safe with her, at least in glimpses. That’s also why I felt what I thought was attraction to my therapist. She saw me. She didn’t need me to perform. It might not have been romantic — maybe it was just my nervous system responding to being seen and accepted for the first time in a long time.The same thing happened with Dave from college. He genuinely saw me — not for what I could do, but for who I was. And in a world where I’ve often been reduced to my usefulness, that meant everything.I’ve spent a lot of time choosing people who weren’t ready to meet me in that place. People who couldn’t hold what I was longing for. And then I’d feel disappointed — sometimes devastated. But I’m trusting the process more now. I’m learning to stop chasing and start listening.I know I can meet someone who holds me, emotionally and physically. My attraction to women has never been the issue — it’s the emotional safety that matters. And it may not come in the package I expect, but I’m open to that now. Maybe that’s a good thing.I’ll probably still slip up sometimes — maybe reach for porn again. But I’m noticing that it’s happening less and less. And what’s come in its place? Energy. Creativity. A sense of possibility.That’s the shift I want to honour today.I’m learning to hold myself — and in doing so, I’m making room to be held by someone else, when the time is right.And that… that feels like a quiet revolution."

Not outsourcing my decisions.I haven’t needed to ask for advice this session — not because I’m above it, but because I’ve internalised the patterns. I know my plays are good.That’s a quiet kind of confidence.Not loud. Not arrogant. Just grounded.I used to feel like poker was chaotic — full of swings I couldn’t control.But today, I feel calm in the middle of it.I’m seeing more clearly.

I thought that being a “good dad” meant being upbeat, saying yes, keeping the energy flowing—even when I had none.But lately, I’ve come to realise something powerful: my energy doesn’t disappear because I’m a bad parent. It disappears when I’m not being honest.Every time I said “yes” when I meant “no,”Every time I pushed through instead of pausing,Every time I put on a version of myself I thought he needed—I was draining a battery I couldn’t recharge.And that made me dread spending time with him. Not because I don’t love him. But because deep down, I knew I wasn’t showing up as me.I was performing. And performance is exhausting.This isn’t just about parenting. I’ve seen it happen with neighbours, with old friends, with anyone I used to wear a mask around. The same dread creeps in. Not because they’re unsafe—but because I’m not safe inside myself when I’m pretending.But something’s changed.My body, my soul, my inner child—whatever you want to call it—has stopped letting me get away with inauthenticity.When I betray myself, it shuts me down. When I honour myself, energy flows.So now, I’m saying no when I need to. Not because I’m harsh, but because I want my yes to mean something.I’m being more honest with my son—not dramatic, just real. And I trust that he can handle it.I’m walking the line between boundaries and compassion, and it’s not perfect, but it’s mine.And most of all, I’m realising this:  Authenticity isn’t a risk—it’s a responsibility. And it’s the only thing that gives me life.If I want to enjoy being with my son, I have to show up as myself. That’s the only way I can truly connect, truly lead, and truly love.Not from a mask.But from me."

For too long. Alone.I’ve come to realize that I don’t give myself credit — not for how far I’ve come, not for the father I am, not for the way I hold it all together. My parents set the bar so low emotionally that I don’t even feel proud when I do better. It’s like I unconsciously replaced “better than them” with “I must be perfect,” and that’s left me always feeling like I’m failing.But today, something shifted.My son broke a curtain rail.Then he knocked over a glass of water near the electrics.And I felt frustrated.But I didn’t explode.I didn’t shut down.I stayed.And even though part of me wanted to disconnect, I explained how I felt. I let him see me — not as a perfect parent, but as a human. I didn’t abandon him. I didn’t abandon myself. And in that moment, I realized something:  I’m a good enough father.I have qualities I would have killed for in a father. I listen. I explain. I take space for myself, and I invite my son into that space with honesty. I give him what I never had.Later, when I noticed myself overeating cake and my body battery dropping to 24, I almost spiraled. But then I realized: I wasn’t failing. My body was simply showing me that today, it felt safe enough to let things rise. The emotional weight I’ve been carrying for years finally had room to breathe.Maybe this was the right time to finally express my authentic self to my son.Maybe I’m learning to listen to what my body wants.Maybe — for the first time — I’m being truly respectful to myself.And maybe that’s enough."

I just didn’t know I was allowed to say that.For a long time, I couldn’t. I had to filter everything I did through someone else’s benefit — because I was never taught that my desires were valid on their own.But now I’m realizing something:  Wanting something for me isn’t selfish — it’s self-honoring.And the irony is, even when I do it for myself, it still ripples outward.My son learns by watching.My inner child learns by being listened to.My life takes shape not through performance, but through truth.So this website?

It wasn’t about running hot, or hitting big hands at the right time. It was about holding my nerve when it mattered most — and that’s where the real growth lives.The Bubble PhaseI found myself hovering just above the danger zone, with a short stack, watching other players panic or overreach. At one point, I had to fold hands like Ace-Queen, Ace-Jack, and even Ace-King — hands that would normally be slam-dunk jams or calls.But this wasn’t a normal spot.This was the ICM bubble.And one bad decision — one mistimed shove — would’ve meant going home with nothing.So I waited.I watched players with bigger stacks than mine throw their tournament lives away with reckless calls and wide shoves, and I reminded myself:  “It’s not about how strong the hand is — it’s about how dangerous the spot is.”Cashing Through PatienceEventually, the short stacks busted. The money bubble burst. And I was still alive.It might have looked passive from the outside, but every fold was a conscious, difficult choice. Every pause, a battle against ego.It’s not easy folding AK on a short stack.It’s not easy trusting that survival — not action — is the most profitable move in that moment.But I did. And it paid off.The Final HandWith about 1.5 big blinds left, I picked up a playable hand. I flopped trip threes — a miracle — but got cracked by a straight on the river.And I was okay with it.Because I didn’t go out on tilt. I didn’t punt.I went out knowing I’d played the bubble exactly how I needed to.Long-Term PerspectiveThis is where real tournament profit comes from.Not the flashy bluffs or the wild hero calls — but the quiet, gritty decisions in high-pressure moments:  Folding good hands  Watching others make mistakes  Trusting that the math and timing are on your sideIt may not look dramatic. It may even seem boring.But these are the hands — or non-hands — that build a winning career.Final Thought  “It may look straightforward, but holding your nerve in those situations is not as easy as it looks.”This was one of those days where I earned every chip.And that $200 cash?

Two stays in hospital.  No addiction to numb the pain, even when the pain was loud.  No running — not in the end.  Just quiet, persistent walking through the fire.I could have lost myself.To weed. To porn. To food.To shame. To despair.But I didn’t.I chose to keep showing up.I Am BlossomingNo one gave me compassion for these things.In fact, many shamed me more when I revealed them.They made me feel even more alone in the moments I most needed to be seen.So if no one else will give it to me — I will.I am okay.I am lovable.And I love myself.What I Know NowI know that one day I’ll find beautiful people.People who love gently, and see me clearly.And I know that if I’m not quite there yet — in terms of health, regulation, ease —I can get there.This path I’m walking — into therapy, into healing —It’s not just for others.It’s for me, too.And I believe, truly, that when I’m around people who love me —I won’t just blossom.

Not explained. Not healed in a rush.Just held.Gently.Without judgment.And in that stillness, there’s a strange kind of peace.🔁 Not Forever, Just For NowI know this isn’t forever.Emptiness is a visitor — not a life sentence.And sometimes what it’s really asking for is my own presence.To sit with myself the way I wish someone had once sat with me.No advice.No distraction.Just… presence.So today, I gave myself that.And it was enough.Not everything needs to be filled.Some spaces are sacred —And maybe this one is where the real connection begins."

I progressively became more manic — until eventually, I entered psychosis.The Illusion That Kept Me SafeIt started with realizing my family never really saw me.That their love came with conditions — with expectations that I’d be someone else entirely.I think my mind, desperate to cope, constructed a story where I was someone important.Someone chosen.Someone whose pain meant something.In psychosis, I remember believing I had a spiritual purpose.That I was on a mission.That I had to go through this darkness because I was being prepared for something greater.Looking back, that wasn’t madness.That was a survival response.My Brain Was Protecting MePsychosis didn’t mean I was broken.It meant the weight of truth — of betrayal, of abandonment, of emotional starvation — was too heavy for me to hold all at once.So my brain tried to carry it for me.By turning trauma into mythology.By turning pain into purpose.And in many ways, it worked.Because I survived.Now I Tell the TruthToday, I no longer need fantasy to make sense of what happened.It hurt because it should have hurt.I felt alone because I was alone.And I broke because no one came to hold me when I needed it most.But that doesn’t mean I’m unlovable.Or unworthy.Or broken beyond repair.It means I’ve lived through something real.And I’m still here.I’m Rewriting It NowThis is what healing looks like:  Naming what really happened.  Honoring the ways I coped.  Letting myself grieve the love I didn’t get.  And writing a new story — not from delusion, but from truth.I’m not the chosen one.I’m just someone who never got what they needed.And I’m learning to give it to myself now.That’s enough.That’s everything."

That’s trauma.And I’m naming it, not to drown in it — but to move through it.🎯 And Then I Hit the 8Later in the same tournament, I shoved Ace-9 off for seven bigs into a short-stacked UTG opener with a $20 bounty.He flipped over Aces. Of course he did.But somehow — I hit a straight on the turn. I won.And then again — Ace-8 offsuit, I shoved for eight bigs.Called by Ace-5 suited. Then Ace-King suited behind that.And somehow — I hit an 8.I didn’t celebrate wildly. I didn’t feel redeemed.But I felt something shift.  Not everything goes against me.Not every hand ends in silence.Sometimes, I hit the 8.And that’s enough — for now.🕊️ The Real Game I’m PlayingI’m not just playing poker.I’m playing the long game of healing.The game of staying regulated when life (and variance) keeps saying “Not yet.”And I’m not broken because it gets to me.I’m not weak because I feel it more on some days.I’m just someone who’s lost more than his fair share —But still keeps sitting down,Still keeps showing up,Still keeps hoping for the next card to fall in his favour.And sometimes, it does."

And maybe some of it has.There are sparks — people at college who I feel a sense of potential with.But I can’t rely on one environment to meet every emotional need I have.And yet, I’m tired. My energy is limited.I’m trying to be mindful — not to force things, not to overextend, not to chase.It’s not an excuse.It’s just where I am.The Things I’ve Already DoneI’ve stopped giving energy to places and people where connection was always out of reach.That took something. That’s a beginning.And in doing that, I’ve created a little more internal space —space where I’m more regulated, more open, more available.But connection hasn’t landed yet in the way I imagined.And maybe that’s because it rarely does.What I’m Longing ForYes, I think I want a relationship.But underneath that, what I’m really longing for is connection.To be seen. To see someone.To feel safe. To feel wanted.To relax around another human being — not because I’m performing, but because I’m finally able to just be.And maybe that starts with smaller things:  A good conversation at college.  A shared moment with someone I barely know.  A smile that lingers just a little longer than usual.Those are the footholds.And right now, I’m in the lonely middle — no longer starving for crumbs, but not yet sitting at the table.This Part is Sacred, TooIt’s easy to think this stage is meaningless — the waiting, the middle, the quiet.But it’s not.This is the part where I choose integrity over desperation.Where I walk the talk. Where I let the discomfort mature me instead of harden me.Where I remind myself that not being chosen by someone doesn’t mean I’ve failed. It just means I’m still on the way.This is where I build the kind of foundation that can hold the love I long for — when it finally arrives.And until then?I’ll keep showing up.Not perfectly. Not always gracefully.But honestly.Because the lonely middle might just be the birthplace of something real."

      "content": "I say to myself that I’m open.But… am I?Am I truly open to connection?Am I welcoming people in — or am I quietly turning away when love starts to approach?There’s a subtle kind of avoidance I’ve started to notice in myself.A subconscious flinch. A retreat into the familiar shelter of solitude, even while outwardly saying I want closeness.So I asked myself honestly:  Do I really want connection? Or am I terrified of it?And the answer is: both.The Price of Not Sitting With ItHere’s what I’ve realized:If I don’t let myself feel the depth of this loneliness —If I keep numbing, distracting, softening it just enough to tolerate —Then I’ll never be desperate or courageous enough to seek what I truly need.I’ll stay just comfortable enough in isolation.Safe, but disconnected.Alive, but not living.A Quiet Kind of GratitudeThat’s why I’m starting to feel something surprising:Gratitude for my loneliness.Because it’s not here to break me. It’s here to move me.To remind me that I was never meant to stay comfortable in isolation.Loneliness is not a flaw — it’s a flare.A message from my deeper self, saying:  “You were made for something more.”And the only way I’ll ever experience the kind of connection I long for — real, mutual, safe — is if I walk toward it. Sword in hand. Nervous system screaming. But still walking.Not Just Willing — WantingI don’t want to just “be okay” on my own anymore.I can be — I’ve proven that.But I want more than okay.I want to connect.To let people see me.To offer my love. To receive it.And if I have to feel every ounce of emptiness first to get there — then so be it.I’ll feel it. I’ll sit with it. And then I’ll walk toward the light.“It’s not about being ready. It’s about being real. And choosing to move anyway.”"

      "date": "June 01, 2025",
      "content": "I’ve been noticing a resistance lately — this deep, quiet fear around sharing the Embracing Authenticity project fully. Around letting myself be seen. Around letting people know who I really am.At first, I thought maybe it was just perfectionism. Or timing. Or not feeling “ready.”But when I sit with it, it feels like something much older. Much deeper.I think I’m afraid because some part of me still believes that if I show people who I truly am, they’ll leave.And that fear didn’t come out of nowhere.🌫️ The Original AbandonmentWhen I look back, my mother never really loved me in the way I needed.She didn’t nurture me.She didn’t see me.She didn’t consider what I wanted, or who I was becoming.And what’s even harder to admit — I think she liked it when I was desperate for her approval. Because in that space, she held the power. She could give or withhold love. And I would keep trying, keep bending, keep proving.So now, as an adult, when I create something that reflects my deepest truth — my real self — it stirs up that old terror:  “What if no one wants this? What if they walk away?”But the truth is…She already walked away.Not physically, but emotionally — from the very beginning.So I’m not really afraid of being abandoned again.I’m afraid of reliving what I already lived through.And that’s what makes this so hard.🧡 The Risk of Being SeenThere’s something vulnerable about building a project like this — about showing people the real me. Because it’s not a performance. It’s not filtered through what I think others want to hear.It’s me. Quietly, honestly, imperfectly… me.And that’s what makes it both terrifying and sacred.Because the fear isn’t just fear.It’s grief.It’s the pain of never having been accepted when it mattered most.And the cautious hope that maybe this time, it could be different.🕯️ A Truth I’m Holding OntoI already feel unseen by most people.So what is it I’m really afraid of losing?Not everyone will get it.But the right people might.And they’ll only find me if I let myself be found.That doesn’t mean I need to shout or overshare or bare everything at once.It just means not hiding.And that’s a risk I want to take.Because the life I want — the connection I long for — doesn’t exist behind a mask.🌱 If This ResonatesIf you’ve felt this too — the fear of being seen, the resistance to sharing what matters — I just want to say:You’re not alone.And the fact that you found your way to these words means that your inner voice is still alive.Still guiding you.Still hoping.Let that be your sign.You’re not broken for being afraid.You’re just someone who’s learning to be seen — maybe for the first time."

A kind of simple, steady companionship.And I felt it — envy.Not the bitter kind.Not the kind that says, “They shouldn’t have that.”But the kind that quietly whispers, “I want that too.”It wasn’t about the display — it was about what it represented:  Acceptance. Presence. Being chosen, without needing to be earned.And as I kept walking, something else rose up. A kind of ache.Not just from the man in me — but from the boy.🌫️ “Big Boys Don’t Cry”That old script came up almost automatically.Even now, after all the healing, part of me still wants to explain away my emotion. To clarify:  “These aren’t deep, uncontrollable sobs. Just a silent weep. Nothing dramatic.”But I know what that is — it’s my ego, still trying to protect the boy from being shamed.The truth is:These tears weren’t weakness.They were release.A soft grieving for the love I never got.👦 The Boy Who Wasn’t Allowed to FeelIt’s not that I’ve never cried. I’ve cried on runs. In therapy. In quiet moments at home.But lately, I’ve realized — it’s not always me crying.Sometimes, it’s the younger part of me — the boy who wasn’t held.The one who had to grow up too soon.The one who thought that staying quiet, staying small, staying strong would somehow keep him safe.And now, when tears come, I don’t just feel sadness.I feel recognition.Like something buried is finally being witnessed.🕊️ A Different Kind of StrengthI don’t want to be the kind of man who holds everything in.I don’t want to be admired for how much I can carry without breaking.I want to be real — even when it’s raw. Even when it’s tender.Because that boy in me never stopped needing love.He just stopped expecting it.And now, when I cry, I’m not ashamed.I’m proud.Because it means he’s still here.Still feeling.Still hoping.And maybe that’s what healing really is:  Letting the boy finally cry —and letting the man finally listen."

Even when I hid.So if I’ve paid that price anyway…why not step out and risk doing some good?There were times in my life — long, dark stretches — where suicide felt like the only option.When connection seemed impossible.When shame wrapped so tightly around me I couldn’t breathe.And in those moments, I didn’t need a perfect mentor.I didn’t need a 10-step recovery plan.I just needed a glimmer.A flicker of proof that someone like me could survive.That maybe I wasn’t beyond repair.That’s why I write.Not to be impressive.Not to be liked.But because if one person finds even the smallest light in what I share — one person lost in the dark, quietly holding on — then every ounce of fear becomes irrelevant.I don’t write for approval.I write because I believe in something bigger than fear:  The power of honesty.The quiet strength in showing up.The healing that comes when one person dares to speak their truth.So when fear whispers,  “You’re exposing too much,”I remind myself:I’m doing this for the version of me who had no one.And maybe, just maybe, for someone else who needs that glimmer now.If even one hurting soul feels less alone,then it’s all worth it.Because I’m not hiding anymore.This is who I am.And I’m standing in it."

Like strength.But today, it felt like nothing.And it was everything.If you’re learning to set boundaries — and it feels clumsy or heavy or unnatural — keep going.Because one day, you’ll walk past someone who used to take up far too much of your emotional life, and you’ll feel… nothing.And that moment will say:  “I’m not available for that anymore.Not because I’m angry.But because I’m free.”"

And I hoarded what was left, afraid she’d find a way to take it back, or use it against me. Because in truth, she always used things against me.And now that I have a level of financial safety — something I’ve never really known — there’s a strange discomfort in me.Like I don’t deserve it.Like something bad might happen.Like I should feel guilty for having something she “gave,” even though it wasn’t truly hers to begin with — and even though it would have come to me eventually, regardless.💔 Why the Guilt LingersBecause the money wasn’t just money.It was the only form of care she ever really offered.Not warmth.Not holding.Not presence.Not attunement.Just the cold basics: shelter, and money.And yet she uses them to tell herself she’s a “good mother,” even while denying and avoiding every emotional responsibility that comes with being one.So of course the guilt isn’t clean.Because the love never was.🕯️ The Truth I’m Holding NowShe passed on that money.And I accepted it.But I no longer accept the emotional strings that were tied to it.Because now I see what it was really about — her needs, not mine.And now I’m using that money not to impress her, not to escape my pain, and not to prove anything.I’m using it to build something different.Something mine.Something peaceful.Something stable.Something I would want my son to inherit — not just financially, but emotionally.✉️ A Letter to Myself  You didn’t take anything that wasn’t already yours.You didn’t manipulate, demand, or exploit.You received what was passed on — and now you get to choose what it means.  This money is not a debt.It’s not a leash.It’s not a symbol of shame.  It’s a resource.It’s an opportunity.It’s a second chance — not for her, but for you.  You get to use it to create a life that reflects your truth.A life rooted in emotional honesty, not performance.A life where your son will never have to wonder if love comes with strings.You’ve earned this life.Not because she handed over the money —But because you survived what couldn’t be bought."

Not over-stimulated.Just… free.This Is the Power of Speaking TruthWhat I shared wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t performative.It was intimate, vulnerable, and honest.And somehow, that gave me energy.That alone tells me something important:  I was meant to do this.To write.To reflect.To speak.To offer what I’ve learned — not as a finished product, but as someone still on the path.Everything I’ve Protected is Ready to Be ReleasedFor so long, I’ve kept things compact and quiet. Hidden in shame.

A reflection of something deeper:  I don’t have anyone I can reliably reach out to when I feel low.No one to hold me, or listen, or just sit with me in the quiet.I used to reach out to my mother, but it always left me emptier.I never felt met — just managed.The interaction often highlighted how lonely I actually was.So instead, I eat.Not fast food. Not in secret. Just more than I need — a quiet act of trying to fill the space where care should be.🧠 This Isn’t About WillpowerAnd I’m not beating myself up about it.I’m running.I’m eating mostly well.I’m slowly losing weight.But I know that if I don’t find new ways to honour the need beneath the craving, this pattern will keep repeating.Because this isn’t about discipline.It’s about grief.It’s the grief of not being held.The grief of doing it alone.The grief of having comfort but not connection.And honestly?Eating like this is still better than some of the other ways I’ve tried to cope in the past.It’s softer. Gentler.It still comes from the part of me trying to survive.🕯️ A Moment of Self-CompassionIf I could say something to myself right now, it would be this:  You’re not bad for wanting comfort.You’re not weak for needing something.You’re just someone who’s carried a lot alone.  You’ve been your own source of care for a long time.And sometimes, that care looks like a pastry and a blanket.That’s okay.  But you also deserve to be held — not just fed.And that hunger deserves to be seen.I don’t have a perfect ending for this.Just a recognition.That food isn’t the problem.Loneliness is.And the more I can meet myself with tenderness — in these small, imperfect moments — the less I’ll need to reach for something else to do it for me."

The kind that makes you wonder what the point of it all is, if it’s just going to be this — disconnection, loneliness, a constant ache for something deeper.But even in those moments — especially in those moments — there was a glimmer inside me. Something small, barely noticeable, but real.It didn’t speak loudly.It didn’t have answers.But it whispered:  “You’re worth saving.”That whisper was the voice of my inner nurturing parent — the part of me that already existed before therapy, before books, before healing work. The part that guided me to seek help, even when I didn’t know why. The part that believed, somehow, that I was worth caring for, even when I couldn’t feel it yet.Therapy didn’t give me this voice — it just helped me trust it.It helped me create space for it to grow.This is a letter from that part of me — to the version of me who didn’t know why life was worth living.🕊️ A Letter from the One Who Never LeftHey, love.I know you don’t see the point right now. I know everything feels flat and far away, like you’re watching life through glass.You’ve carried so much — not just the weight of your own pain, but the silence, the neglect, the way love never quite landed in the places you needed it most.You’ve felt alone for so long that it became normal.But I’m here to tell you:You were never truly alone.I was always here. Quiet, patient, waiting.Every time you felt like giving up, I held the thread. Every time you got back up — even just to brush your teeth or sit in the sunlight — that was me, holding you from the inside.You don’t have to know the meaning of life to keep living.You don’t need a big dream or a clear purpose.You just need to know this:  You matter.You are worth caring for.And I will not abandon you.Even when others did.Even when the world felt cold.Even when you doubted everything.I stayed.I’m still here.And I always will be.With love,The one inside you who never left.If these words found you — it’s not by accident.That same quiet voice lives inside you, too.The part that longs for something more.The part that led you here.You may not trust it yet.You may not know how to let it lead.But it’s there.And when you find the right environment — the right space, the right support — that part of you will begin to grow.Not because someone tells it to, but because it’s ready.Because it always was.Let this be your reminder:You were never broken.You just needed the kind of care that lets you unfold.And you still do."

I’d try to make something happen—start conversations, hold space, extend myself—just to feel a sense of closeness, even if the energy wasn’t mutual.These days, I’ve stopped chasing. I say hello. I show up. I remain open. But I don’t twist myself into something I’m not just to fit into someone else’s world.And it’s freeing.It means I can walk my dog and smile at a stranger without expecting anything back. I can message someone once without spiraling if they don’t respond. I can go to the gym, or a class, or the sauna, and just enjoy being around people without needing to be chosen.Connection that’s forced never lasts. It comes from a place of fear. But when it flows naturally, it feels safe, reciprocal, and steady.I’m learning to let relationships unfold without trying to script the ending. I’m learning to let silence speak. I’m learning that the people who are meant to connect with me—really connect—won’t need convincing.And in the meantime, I’m choosing peace over pursuit."

Something in me whispered:  “What do they want?”“This won’t last.”“Be careful.”I wasn’t used to kindness without strings.I wasn’t used to softness that didn’t lead to pain.And it made me realise—I wasn’t triggered by the person. I was triggered by what kindness used to mean.Because in the past, it often came just before the drop.Before the withdrawal. The criticism. The confusion.But now, I’m letting myself learn something new.Kindness can be safe.Gentle people exist.Not everyone who leans in is preparing to walk away.It takes time.It takes regulation.It takes patience with the parts of me that still brace for harm.But I’m learning.And slowly, I’m letting kindness feel like home again."

An old unmet need. A version of me still waiting to be chosen.So I pause.I breathe.And I remind myself:  If it’s real, I won’t have to chase it.  If it’s mutual, I won’t have to convince anyone.  If it’s meant, it will meet me halfway.This is how I’m unlearning pursuit as proof of worth.This is how I’m letting myself be chosen—without performing, pleasing, or proving.And some days, that choice changes everything."

It’s presence.A soft voice. A grounded energy. A reminder that I’m not wrong or broken or failing—I’m just in a part of me that’s overwhelmed. That part needs comfort, not correction.Here’s what I try to tell myself now:  “Hey. I see you.This is old.You’re safe now, but it makes sense that it doesn’t feel that way.You’re not too much.You’re just feeling a lot.Let’s breathe through it together.”That voice?

It’s a misalignment.Now I’m unlearning the belief that asking for what I truly need is a burden. I’m unlearning the reflex to apologise for longing.

Where mutual effort replaces emotional fireworks. Where I don’t feel a need to prove or perform.Slow burns grow stronger with time.They’re based in consistency, not chaos.They feel like warmth—not wildfire.It’s a different kind of excitement. More grounded. More sustainable.And I’m starting to see that the relationships worth keeping often begin this way—not with a bang, but with a steady light I learn to trust.That’s what I’m open to now.Not intensity.But intimacy."

But over time, I’ve come to realise that solitude is where the most important conversations happen: the ones I have with myself.This space has become fertile ground. It’s where my creativity grows, where my emotional regulation resets, and where I hear the quieter truths I used to drown out. It’s where I’ve begun to build the life I actually want, not the one I thought I had to chase.In this stillness, I’ve started writing again. Reflecting. Cooking properly. Taking care of my space. And when I do connect with someone, it feels more grounded—like a choice, not a need. There’s no grasping anymore. Just openness.Solitude has also helped me get clearer on the kind of relationship I want in the future. I want mutual care, not obligation. Grace, not guilt. I want to be in a place where I give my energy because I want to, not because I’m trying to hold something together that doesn’t support me back.And I know I’ll miss this time, one day—when life is fuller and louder again. So right now, I’m soaking it in.I don’t feel alone in the way I used to. I feel accompanied by my own presence.And for now, that’s enough."

And I’m allowed to honour them—even if someone else doesn’t understand them.The moment I stopped apologising for my needs was the moment I started building healthier relationships—especially with myself.Because when I meet my needs with respect, I attract people who do the same.And that changes everything."

When it’s free from guilt.Doing nothing lets my nervous system settle.It reminds me that I’m not a machine.It reconnects me with the part of me that exists beyond my to-do list.It’s not laziness. It’s listening.To the part of me that’s tired. The part that’s stretched thin.

Sometimes fear.I’ve come to realise that even now, in a peaceful home, that same tension can flood back like it never left.So I listen to it.I’ve given myself permission not to answer the door unless I know who it is. I don’t feel obligated anymore. My nervous system deserves safety. I don’t need to retraumatise myself in the name of politeness.Some people might think I’m being dramatic. But this is the kind of healing that happens quietly, in the body. I don’t owe anyone exposure therapy. I owe myself compassion.And healing, for me, often means protecting the part of me that once didn’t get protected.

When I’m avoiding something, it leaves a weight. A tension that doesn’t lift even after hours of scrolling or sitting in silence.The trick, for me, is to pause and ask:  “What am I protecting myself from right now?”If the answer is exhaustion, I rest fully. Guilt-free.If the answer is fear, I get curious. I remind myself I can start small.

His absence makes itself known in small, quiet moments: making food for one, walking without his chatter, tidying a room that never got messy.I remind myself that this time apart is part of what makes me a better parent. It gives me the capacity to show up fully when he’s here. And I know he’s okay. I know I’m okay.But I still miss him.I used to interpret missing someone as a weakness. A sign I wasn’t coping.

Like that time I hit a big score in a poker tournament. It was a bounty event, and I pulled $3,200 in mystery bounties. That voice came crawling in, saying, “That was just luck. That doesn’t count.”But what that voice doesn’t mention is the hand I busted on—where I got my chips in ahead and still lost. Or the other tournaments where I played well, ran deep, and just couldn’t dodge the variance at the final hurdle.That voice forgets that I’m consistently improving. That I’m showing up, reviewing hands, managing emotion, making smarter choices. The results haven’t caught up yet—but they will. And I can feel that.The Role of the VoiceI’ve come to realize that voice isn’t trying to ruin me. It’s trying to protect me. In its own clumsy way, it’s been a survival mechanism—keeping me small, safe, quiet. It’s the voice of the critical parent, or the wounds of a much younger version of me, afraid of getting too confident and being knocked down.And you know what? I get it. That part of me has done its job well for a long time. But I’m no longer living in the past it was created to protect me from.Letting It Speak—But Not SteerI’m not trying to kill off that voice. It still has a role. It can offer a pause, a moment of skepticism before I leap too far. But it doesn’t get to steer the ship anymore.Now, I choose which voice takes the wheel.  The one that sees my effort.The one that recognizes my emotional growth.The one that values steady improvement over sudden success.I trust that as I keep walking this path—whether in poker, in life, or in the quiet moments alone—that voice will grow quieter. Not because it’s wrong, but because it’s no longer needed in the same way.In Case You’ve Got One TooIf you’ve got a voice like this—whispering doubt or downplaying your wins—just know this:You don’t have to shut it up.You just have to stop letting it drive.Let it ride in the backseat.

It was a run — a genuine heater — and I didn’t take it in.I made nearly $20,000 in three months playing low-stakes tournaments with an average buy-in of $35. And at the time, I didn’t shout about it. I didn’t feel arrogant. But maybe I didn’t fully absorb it either. I kept playing, thinking the run would last forever. When it didn’t, I wasn’t prepared for how hard the downswing would hit.And yet, that downswing taught me more than the winning ever did.Refinement Over ResultsWhat I’ve learned is that the game isn’t about momentary highs or punishing lows. It’s about refinement — about making slightly better decisions over time, trusting the small signals, and building a self that doesn’t need external results to know they’re on track.Sometimes that means folding nines on the bubble. Sometimes that means walking away when every part of you wants to prove something. And sometimes, it means looking back and giving yourself credit for things you never stopped to acknowledge.Poker mirrors life: how you handle the streaks, how you recover from the crashes, and how you trust your process when there’s no immediate feedback.Discernment, Not PerfectionThere’s a quiet voice now — the one that asks, “Is this too marginal?” It doesn’t always know the answer. But every time I pause and assess instead of rushing to act, I get slightly closer to clarity. That’s the game now. Not perfection, but discernment. Not dominance, but awareness.And it’s not just about poker. That mindset ripples into everything.Trusting Myself AgainI’ve let ego drive a lot of decisions in my past — in poker, in relationships, in life. But something’s shifted. I’m not chasing wins to feel whole. I’m not playing to escape. I’m playing because I love the game, because it suits my energy, and because I’m building a life that doesn’t need me to constantly prove my worth.I’m learning to trust myself — not blindly, but steadily. I know I’ll keep refining. I’ll make fewer big errors. And the little ones? I’ll spot them sooner and let them teach me.A Quiet Kind of FreedomIf poker becomes my main source of income, it won’t be because I had no other choice — it’ll be because it gives me the freedom to live a life I believe in. To rest when I need to. To support the people I choose to help. To stay home with my son, walk the dog, and still show up fully in the moments that matter.That’s the real prize.And today, I’m not chasing it. I’m already living it."

I don’t let one hand define my worth.Now, when I take a bad beat, I take a breath. I log the hand. I review it later. I remind myself: if I made the right decision, I can live with the result.Poker’s become a mirror. It shows me where I’m grounded—and where I’m not. It reflects how I handle chaos. How I deal with luck. How I recover from disappointment.And lately, I’m proud of what I’m seeing.My nervous system is steadier. My self-talk is kinder. My attachment to outcome is loosening. I’m not trying to prove I’m good—I’m just trying to play well. Big difference.The game didn’t become less volatile. I just became more regulated.And it shows."

I was in a one-way emotional transaction.It’s not that I want to stop being caring.It’s that I want mutuality.I want to be in relationships where we both hold space.Where both voices matter.Where I don’t leave every interaction feeling like I’ve poured from a cup that never gets refilled.Letting go of the “therapist” role in friendships hasn’t been easy.Sometimes it means walking away.Sometimes it means uncomfortable boundaries.But every time, it means reclaiming a little more of my energy.Because I’m not here to fix everyone.I’m here to connect.And I want that connection to nourish both people—not just one."

Then louder. And louder. Until you can’t ignore it.That’s what’s been happening to me.I left a relationship that hurt. At the time, I knew it was hard. But I didn’t realize just how unhealthy it truly was — not until I had enough distance to finally feel myself again.At the Time, I Thought It Was About the MessI used to come home, exhausted, and the kitchen would be a mess. I’d said how important it was for me to walk into a calm, clean space — we talked about it, agreed on it, more than once.But nothing changed. Again and again, I’d open the door to the same chaos.At first, I thought I was being fussy. Controlling, even. But it wasn’t about the dishes. Not really.What hurt was this:We made an agreement. I expressed a need. And it kept getting ignored.Over time, the mess became a symbol — not of clutter, but of emotional neglect. A quiet reminder that I didn’t matter enough to be considered. That my nervous system, already fried, wasn’t something worth soothing.The Truth Behind the DynamicWith time, I’ve started to see it more clearly.It wasn’t just the mess.It was being moaned about behind my back instead of spoken to.It was the passive aggression instead of honest connection.It was the slow, eroding silence of a partner who stopped trying.It was a spiral into decay, and I was stuck inside it — dysregulated, confused, constantly firefighting. I didn’t have space to reflect, to zoom out, to make sense of what was happening.And even if I had… I carried beliefs that kept me there.  “I can’t leave — I’d be abandoning my son.”“He needs both parents. Even if this is hurting me.”It’s only now I can say this with love:That was fear speaking. Not love.And fear kept me stuck in something that gave me nothing back.A relationship that took and took, while I kept showing up — hoping for change that never came.What I Now Understand About MyselfWhen I look back, I don’t see a weak version of myself.I see someone who loved deeply. Who tried hard.Who fought for his son.Who believed the best in someone, even when their actions said otherwise.And I also see this:A pattern I was used to. One-sided relationships.Giving more than I received.Feeling responsible for keeping the peace, even when it came at the cost of my own.But now? I’ve stepped away. And I’m building something entirely different.I’m Still Unfinished — But I’m FreeThere’s a part of me that still hesitates to let others into my space. My home’s a mess. I’m juggling ten projects. I’m not perfectly organized or emotionally polished.And for a while, I thought I needed to fix all that before letting anyone see me.But that was the old belief talking again.  “You must be perfect to be loved.”Now I know:I don’t need to be finished to be worthy.I don’t need to be tidy to be safe.I don’t need to perform to be accepted.I want to be seen as I am, not as I perform.Because anything else is performance — and I’ve done enough of that to last a lifetime.It’s a New WorldIt really is.Not because everything is fixed.Not because I’ve arrived.But because I’ve finally left the places that drained me.And I’ve begun to trust the stillness.Now, I get to enjoy the peace I used to beg for.Now, I get to build slowly — with presence, not pressure.Now, I get to love from abundance, not depletion.And now, I get to show my son — not through words, but through how I live — what it looks like to walk away from what hurts, and choose what heals.It’s a new world.Not a perfect one.But a real one.And I’m here for it.If this resonates with you — if you’ve ever felt like your needs were too much, or like peace was something you had to earn — I hope you know: you don’t have to wait until you’re polished to be loved. You just have to be willing to show up as you are. That’s where freedom lives."

Or who leave me feeling smaller, not fuller, after a conversation.Now, I honour that quiet voice inside—the one that knows when a connection doesn’t feel right.I can care about someone and still choose distance.I can love someone and still limit contact.I can value peace more than I value being perceived as “nice.”My energy is finite. My presence is a gift. And I’m learning to give it with discernment.Not from fear.From self-respect."

Years of growing up around someone who was disappointed in me for simply being me. Someone who used shame to control, guilt to manipulate, and love as a conditional tool.That was my mother.And when you’re raised on that kind of treatment, it becomes the lens through which you see the world.You don’t develop rose-tinted glasses — you develop broken ones.Cracked by criticism.Smudged with shame.Distorted by disappointment that isn’t even real anymore.It’s exhausting.Because no matter how kind someone is, how much goodwill they hold toward you — you still find yourself bracing.Interpreting warmth as performance.Kindness as pressure.Silence as judgment.You’re constantly preparing for a hit that never comes.And yet…That moment in therapy reminded me that these projections aren’t facts.They’re old fears wearing new faces.My therapist didn’t shame me. She held me.And in that moment, something quietly shifted.I don’t want to see people through broken glass anymore.But healing isn’t about snapping your fingers and suddenly seeing clearly.It’s about noticing when the distortion shows up — and gently challenging it.I’m not broken.I’m just someone who’s learning to trust that being seen doesn’t have to mean being shamed.Not anymore."

I’d override signals from my body in order to stay productive, stay disciplined, stay on track.But now, I notice the number.If I wake up at 72% and I’m feeling slow, I honour it. I don’t force the run. I shift my priorities. I choose activities that nourish rather than drain.And when I wake up at 95%? I go for it. I take advantage of the clarity, the spark, the flow. But I still pace myself. I don’t want to burn it all down by noon.The real wisdom isn’t in the number — it’s in the relationship I’ve built with it. A gentler, more responsive way of living. One that says: I don’t have to crush every day. I just need to stay attuned.When I live this way, I find I’m more consistent. More creative. More emotionally balanced. Less reactive.The body knows.

Speaking the words you never thought you’d say out loud.  Realizing that your past doesn’t define your worth.And when that happens — something powerful shifts.The walls don’t just crack. They let the light in.You see yourself more clearly, not through the lens of your wounds, but through the clarity of your humanity.  Shame can’t survive where acceptance lives.It can’t grow in the soil of self-compassion.Letting the light in isn’t about ignoring your pain.It’s about choosing to love yourself in the middle of it.It’s looking at the most hidden parts and saying,“You’re allowed to be here. And you’re still worthy of love.”When shame softens, life begins again.Not from the polished places — but from the ones you dared to bring into the light."

So does healing. So does intimacy.Sometimes the world quiets down not to punish you — but to give you space to hear yourself again.Sometimes the ache of loneliness is a doorway — an invitation to turn inward and ask:  What parts of me am I avoiding?  What kind of connection do I truly long for?  Am I showing up as myself, or just someone I think they’ll accept?You are not alone in your aloneness. Many of us are walking parallel paths — close in feeling, even if far in proximity.And while real connection may feel far away right now, it doesn’t mean it’s gone. It means you’re in the in-between — the part where you reconnect with yourself so you’re ready when the right people arrive.Stay soft. Stay open.

For not bouncing back fast enough.But what if your responses have been reasonable all along?What if your nervous system is just doing its best with what it learned?What if you’re not a problem to be solved — but a person to be understood?Healing isn’t about fixing yourself into acceptability.It’s about softening toward the parts of you that never got what they needed.You’re not too much.

Awkward. Exposed.But that doesn’t mean it is wrong. It just means you’re somewhere new — and your nervous system hasn’t caught up yet.The key is to notice the discomfort — and stay with it long enough to understand what it’s really telling you.Is it fear? Or is it unfamiliarity?Is it danger? Or is it the edge of your old identity?You don’t need to push through recklessly. But you also don’t need to back away automatically.Sometimes the most courageous thing you can do is breathe and stay. Just a little longer. Long enough to realise:  This discomfort isn’t hurting me.

Notice what actually matters.  Reconnect with parts of ourselves we’ve rushed past.Sometimes healing happens in the stillness — not because everything is fixed, but because we finally stop running long enough to feel.So if today feels slower than you planned… let it.There’s strength in stillness.There’s wisdom in quiet.There’s power in choosing your own pace, even when the world keeps shouting “hurry.”You’re not behind.

Being seen is vulnerable — but it’s also where healing lives.Letting someone see the real you is a risk. It means showing your rough edges, your unfinished healing, your honest needs. It means saying, “This is me. I hope you stay — but even if you don’t, I’m still worthy.”That’s courage.And that courage doesn’t need to be loud. Sometimes it looks like:  Saying something real in a quiet room.  Showing up without the polished version of yourself.  Letting your guard down even when you’re not sure how it will land.You weren’t made to be invisible. You weren’t made to be a projection of what others find comfortable. You were made to live, connect, breathe — as you are.Let yourself be seen. Even if your voice shakes. Even if it’s messy. You’re not too much — you’re just real. And that’s enough."

Real strength, I’ve learned, isn’t about being invincible.It’s about being honest.It’s about being soft — and still showing up.Softness is allowing yourself to cry when you need to.It’s saying “I’m not okay” without apology.It’s holding space for others without losing yourself.It’s staying open in a world that taught you to shut down.There is nothing weak about that.In fact, softness might be one of the most radical forms of strength there is — because it goes against everything we were taught about what makes us worthy or safe.You don’t have to prove your strength by how much you can endure in silence.Let your strength be soft.

And without safety, we can’t fully live.But here’s the thing — trust doesn’t have to come back all at once.It can start small:  Letting someone see you when you’re struggling.  Believing a kind word without brushing it off.  Sitting with discomfort instead of running from it.Learning to trust again isn’t a big, dramatic leap — it’s a series of gentle choices. To stay. To try. To believe that not everyone will hurt you. And more importantly… that you won’t abandon yourself again either.Sometimes, it starts with trusting your own voice. The whisper that says:  “I deserve more.”“I don’t need to earn love.”“I am safe now.”Rebuilding trust means making space for all of you — even the scared parts. Especially the scared parts. Because those are the ones that need the most reassurance.You might not trust easily. You might still flinch. But that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It means you’re healing. Slowly. Bravely.And every time you soften — even just a little — that’s trust returning.Trust is not a destination. It’s a direction. And you’re already on the way."

      "content": "I’ve been noticing something lately.I don’t feel lonely. At least not in the way I used to. The ache, the restlessness, the sense that something vital was missing — it’s just… not there right now.And it’s not because I’ve filled my life with people. I haven’t. It’s not because I’ve found some perfect relationship or finally cracked the code on connection.It’s simpler than that.I’m just enjoying my life.There’s peace in my routines — walking the dog, sharing time with my son, focusing on my goals. There’s a quiet joy in the everyday. And the deeper truth is: I trust myself more than I ever have. I’m looking after myself in ways that I used to wish someone else would.It’s like I’ve stopped waiting to be chosen. I’ve started choosing myself.And here’s the liberating part: if I never find a partner, if I never fall madly in love again, if it’s just me and the life I’m building — that’s okay. More than okay. Because this life? It’s worth living.I’m worthwhile.And I’m even having a bit of fun.That’s not something I would have said a year ago. Back then, everything felt like a waiting room. Like life was on pause until something or someone came along to make it feel complete.Now, the completeness comes from within. It’s in the mornings I wake up and feel calm. It’s in the meals I cook for myself. It’s in the moments of reflection, the laughter with my son, the breath of fresh air on a solo walk.I think this might be what healing feels like. Not some loud, triumphant breakthrough — but a soft settling into who I am. A quiet joy that doesn’t need to be proven.And from this place? If someone comes into my life, they’ll be met with my wholeness, not my hope that they’ll fix what was broken.Because I’m not broken.I’m free."

      "content": "There’s a sharpness to disgust.It feels righteous. Final. Like we’re above whatever — or whoever — triggered it.But sometimes… that disgust isn’t what we think it is.Sometimes it’s jealousy in a clever costume.We see someone being loud, confident, playful, free — and we feel it in our gut.“Ugh, who does she think she is?”“Why’s he so full of himself?”It feels like judgment, but deep down, it might be something else.  It might be a part of us whispering, “I wish I could do that.”When we’ve been shamed or punished for self-expression, joy, boldness, or even just taking up space, we can grow to resent those qualities in others. Not because they’re wrong — but because they remind us of something we’ve buried in ourselves.Disgust is sharp. Jealousy is vulnerable.It’s easier to roll our eyes than admit we want something. Especially if we believe we don’t deserve it — or that it’s “not for people like us.”But healing means softening that disgust. Getting curious. Asking:  What is it about this person that gets under my skin?  What are they expressing that I’ve been taught to suppress?  Is there a version of me that longs to be more like that?Sometimes the people we judge are mirrors — reflecting the parts of us we’re scared to reclaim.And when we can name that with honesty, the judgment loosens.The jealousy softens.The healing begins."

      "content": "There’s a quiet lie that so many of us carry.That we’re broken. Flawed beyond repair. That if people knew the real us — the messy, anxious, tired, too-much or not-enough version — they’d turn away.But here’s the truth:You’re not broken.You’ve been wounded, sure. Shaped by pain. Molded by expectations that were never truly yours. But underneath all that?You’re whole. Always were.Sometimes healing isn’t about fixing anything. It’s about unlearning — letting go of the beliefs, patterns, and roles you had to adopt just to survive.  Healing is remembering who you were before the world taught you to be small.This journey you’re on — it’s not a self-improvement project. It’s a self-reclamation.It’s okay to grieve the time you spent thinking you were broken. To mourn the energy spent trying to be “better” when you were already enough.And it’s also okay to feel resistance when you read this. That voice that says “yeah, but not me.” I know that voice. I carried it for years.But I promise you — you are not beyond repair. Because you were never shattered in the first place.You are becoming again.More yourself.More free.More whole.And that’s not because you’ve fixed everything — it’s because you finally stopped believing you were broken in the first place.You’re not broken. You’re remembering. And that’s more than enough."
