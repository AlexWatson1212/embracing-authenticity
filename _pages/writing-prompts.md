<p class="lead">
These prompts are not homework.
They’re quiet invitations to notice what’s true for you today —
without needing to perform, impress, or turn it into content.
</p>

<p>
You can use them in a notebook, on your phone, in a notes app, or just in your head.
There is no “right” way to do this.
Even a few honest sentences are enough.
</p>

<h2>How to Use These Prompts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pick <strong>one</strong> prompt that catches your attention — not the “right” one.</li>
  <li>Set a timer for 5–10 minutes, or stop sooner if you feel done.</li>
  <li>Write without editing or cleaning it up for anyone else.</li>
  <li>When you’re finished, take a breath and notice how your body feels.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If anything big or painful comes up, it’s okay to pause,
ground yourself, and bring it to therapy or a trusted person.
You don’t have to carry it alone.

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Bringing This Into Therapy (If You Want To)</h2>

<p>
You don’t have to share your writing publicly for it to matter.
Most of the work on this site grew from thousands of private notes over many years.
If something important appears as you write, you can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read a line or two aloud in therapy.</li>
  <li>Share the feeling, even if you don’t share the details.</li>
  <li>Use a prompt again after a session to see what’s shifted.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There’s no rush and no requirement to “keep up”.
These prompts are here to meet you whenever you’re ready.
