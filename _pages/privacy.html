      <p><strong>1. Your Privacy Matters</strong><br />
      I take your privacy seriously. This site does not collect personal data unless you choose to share it — for example, by contacting me directly or subscribing to updates.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Email & Communication</strong><br />
      If you contact me, I’ll use your information only to reply or provide updates if requested. Your data will never be shared, sold, or misused.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Cookies & Analytics</strong><br />

      <p><strong>4. External Links</strong><br />
      This site may link to external resources (e.g., YouTube, articles). I am not responsible for the privacy practices of those third-party sites.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Data Retention</strong><br />
      If you share data (such as via email), it will be kept only as long as necessary to respond or fulfill your request, unless legally required to keep it longer.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Your Choices</strong><br />
      You may request that I delete any personal information you've shared by emailing me at <strong>contactembracingauthenticity@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Updates to This Policy</strong><br />
      This policy may change as the site evolves. Updates will always be posted on this page.</p>
