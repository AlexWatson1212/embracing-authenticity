      <p><strong>Who this is for:</strong><br>
      This page is for anyone who feels like they’ve been surviving, not living — whether you're 12 or 112.  
      If you want a clearer path home to yourself, this guide will meet you where you are.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you've found your way here, part of you already knows there's more to life than what you've been told. This is a soft place to land and a steady hand for your journey home to yourself.</p>

    <div style="background: #ffeaea; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #a00; margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      <p><strong>Please read this before you begin:</strong><br>
      Self-discovery can stir up memories, emotions, or trauma that have been buried for years. If you don’t have much support right now, we encourage you to be gentle with yourself. Take your time. There’s no rush. And if possible, consider walking this path with a therapist, guide, or trusted support. You don’t have to do this alone — and we wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>This isn’t a course. It’s not something you “complete.”</strong><br>
    It’s a path to walk at your own pace — gently, honestly, and with enough space to actually feel. Along the way, you’ll meet tools, reflections, and insights I’ve gathered on my own healing path. Use what helps. Leave what doesn’t.</p>

    <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
      <h3>📔 Downloadable Notion Template</h3>
      <p>If you'd like a companion to help track your journey and gently guide your reflections, here’s a Notion template you can use or duplicate:</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">🛠️ <strong>Bonus:</strong> If you'd like, you can turn your version of this journal into a <strong>live website</strong> with one click — perfect for documenting your own journey, building your own space online, or even creating something for others. No tech skills required. Just duplicate the template, and the option is built in.</p>
