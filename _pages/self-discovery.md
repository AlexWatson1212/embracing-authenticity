      <p><strong>Who this is for:</strong><br>
      This page is for anyone who feels like they’ve been surviving, not living — whether you’re 12 or 112.
      If you want a clearer path back to yourself, this guide will meet you where you are.</p>
      <p class="sd-mini"><strong>Important:</strong> You don’t need to be “good at healing” to use this. You just need to be willing to take one small step at a time.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you’ve found your way here, part of you already knows there’s more to life than pressure, performance, and proving.
      This is a soft place to land — and a steady hand as you learn to come home to yourself.
    </p>

    <div class="sd-warning">
      <p><strong>Please read this before you begin:</strong><br>
      Self-discovery can stir up memories, emotions, or trauma that have been buried for years.
      If you don’t have much support right now, go gently. Take your time. There’s no rush.
      And if possible, consider walking this path with a therapist, guide, or trusted support.
      You don’t have to do this alone — and we wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sd-soft">
      <p><strong>A very real note for beginners:</strong><br>
      Sometimes you’ll feel worse before you feel better — not because you’re broken, but because you’ve stopped numbing.
      If you feel overwhelmed, step back. Choose safety. Do something small and steady (food, water, sleep, a shower, a short walk, a hot tea).
      Healing isn’t a race. <em>Healing unfolds at the speed of safety.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>This isn’t a course. It’s not something you “complete.”</strong><br>
    Think of these as doorways. You can step into whichever feels right, return later, or skip ahead.
    Healing isn’t linear. Use what helps. Leave what doesn’t.</p>

    <!-- START HERE -->
    <div id="start" class="sd-card">
      <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Start Here (the 2-minute version)</h3>
      <p class="sd-mini">If you’re new, start here. If you’re not new, you might still want to come back here on hard days.</p>

      <ol style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0.25rem 1.2rem;">
        <li><strong>Check your body:</strong> “Am I tense, tired, hungry, overstimulated?”</li>
        <li><strong>Name one feeling:</strong> Pick one: sad, scared, angry, lonely, ashamed, hopeful, loving, joyful, longing, accepting.</li>
        <li><strong>Do one caring action:</strong> Water, food, tea, fresh air, a short walk, tidy one small area, or lie down.</li>
      </ol>

      <p style="margin:0.75rem 0 0;"><strong>Gentle truth:</strong> A “low-demand day” can be a healthy day. You don’t need to earn rest.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
      <h3>Downloadable Notion Template</h3>
      <p>If you’d like something simple to track your journey (without turning it into a performance), here’s a Notion template you can duplicate:</p>

      <iframe src="https://alexander-clive-watson.notion.site/ebd/2199bebccf22801891b9ed9965067af0"
              width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <strong>Optional:</strong> If you ever want to, you can turn your journal into a simple public page later.
        But there’s no pressure. This is allowed to stay private. It can just be for you.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            Safety isn’t pretending everything is fine. It’s your body learning: “I’m not in danger right now.”
            Sometimes safety is a locked door. Sometimes it’s saying no. Sometimes it’s a quiet home.
            Safety is the base layer that makes healing possible.

      <h3>Doorway 1: Reparenting – Laying the Foundation</h3>
      <p><em>Before anything else, we learn to become a safe place for ourselves.</em></p>

      <ul class="accordion-list">

            <span class="accordion-arrow">▶</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            Reparenting is learning to meet your own emotional needs with steadiness and care.
            It means becoming the adult you needed — the one who listens, soothes, and guides without cruelty.
          </div>

          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            Discipline without care becomes self-bullying.
            Care without any structure can drift.
            Reparenting is kind structure: small habits, gentle standards, and repair when you fall off.

          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            Your inner child is the part of you that still feels old pain and old needs.
            When that part feels unseen, urges often show up (food, scrolling, porn, spending, numbing).
            The goal isn’t shame — it’s understanding and care.

          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            Trust is built through repetition, not intensity.
            Two minutes of checking in every day beats a big “breakthrough” once a month.

            Instead of “What’s wrong with me?” try: “What’s unmet in me?”

        You’re not broken. You’re not behind.
