      <p><strong>Who this is for:</strong><br>
      This page is for anyone who feels like they’ve been surviving, not living — whether you're 12 or 112.
      If you want a clearer path home to yourself, this guide will meet you where you are.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you've found your way here, part of you already knows there's more to life than what you've been told. This is a soft place to land and a steady hand for your journey home to yourself.</p>

    <div style="background: #ffeaea; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #a00; margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      <p><strong>Please read this before you begin:</strong><br>
      Self-discovery can stir up memories, emotions, or trauma that have been buried for years. If you don’t have much support right now, we encourage you to be gentle with yourself. Take your time. There’s no rush. And if possible, consider walking this path with a therapist, guide, or trusted support. You don’t have to do this alone — and we wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>This isn’t a course. It’s not something you “complete.”</strong><br>
    Think of these as doorways. You can step into whichever feels right, return later, or skip ahead. Healing isn’t linear. Use what helps. Leave what doesn’t.</p>

    <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">

      <h3>Doorway 1: Reparenting – Laying the Foundation</h3>
      <p><em>Before anything else, we learn to become a safe place for ourselves.</em></p>

      <ul class="accordion-list">
        <li class="accordion-item">

            What is reparenting?
            <span class="accordion-arrow">▶</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            Reparenting is learning to meet your own emotional needs with steadiness and care. It means becoming the adult you needed — one who listens, soothes, and guides without judgment.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button">
            Why emotional safety is the starting point
            <span class="accordion-arrow">▶</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            The nervous system can’t heal in threat. Safety lets your body soften enough to feel, process, and integrate. Without safety, even good tools feel like pressure.
          </div>
        </li>

            <span class="accordion-arrow">▶</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            “Inner child” names the younger part of you that still holds unmet needs and old emotions. Building a relationship here grows compassion, clarity, and self-trust.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button">

          <div class="accordion-content">
            Tiny rituals — a two-minute morning check-in, tea breaks, walks, or “watching diggers” — are anchors. Structure builds safety through repetition, not force.
          </div>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            Like LEGO, healing is built piece by piece. Small bricks of care click together into something sturdy. You don’t need to finish; you only need the next brick.

          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            Keep it simple. Ask, “How am I, really?” Then do one caring action your body can feel: stretch, breathe, make food, step outside. Consistency over intensity.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Gentle action:</strong> Begin with a two-minute morning check-in. Ask: “How am I feeling today, really?”</p>
