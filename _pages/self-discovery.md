      <h3>🕯️ Step 1: Awareness</h3>
      <p>Begin by noticing. What parts of yourself have you been hiding? When do you feel most disconnected — and most alive? Awareness is the first light that leads us home.</p>

      <h3>🎭 Step 2: Conditioning & the False Self</h3>

      <h2>✨ From Survival Roles to Real Connection</h2>
      <p>A path for those who gave too much, asked too little, and are learning how to receive.</p>
      <p>Some of us grew up learning that love meant being useful. That connection required caretaking. That our needs didn’t matter as much as keeping the peace. This journey is for those of us unlearning that. It’s a gentle roadmap — messy, human, and real.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>🛑 <strong><a href="/blog/leaving-the-roles-behind">Step 1: Leaving the Roles Behind</a></strong> — Naming the pattern and reclaiming our energy.</li>
        <li>💔 <strong><a href="/blog/what-i-never-got-to-say-to-my-dad">Step 2: The Grief of Not Being Seen</a></strong> — Exploring heartbreak for what never was and offering ourselves what they couldn’t.</li>

        <li>🤝 <strong><a href="/blog/being-truly-held">Step 5: Being Truly Held</a></strong> — Where safety and healing quietly settle in.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>🔁 This journey isn't linear. You may return to old roles. You may feel the grief all over again. That’s okay. The path forward is a spiral, not a straight line. But each step brings you closer to connection that’s real.</p>
