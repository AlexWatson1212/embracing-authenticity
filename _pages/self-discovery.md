        <p><strong>Who this is for:</strong><br>
          This page is for anyone who feels like they’ve been surviving, not living — whether you’re 12 or 112.
          If you want a clearer path back to yourself, this will meet you where you are.
        </p>
        <p class="sd-mini"><strong>Important:</strong> You don’t need to be “good at healing” to use this. You just need one small step at a time.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you’ve found your way here, part of you already knows there’s more to life than pressure, performance, and proving.
        This is a soft place to land — and a steady hand as you learn to come home to yourself.
      </p>

      <div class="sd-warning">
        <p><strong>Please read this before you begin:</strong><br>
          Self-discovery can stir up memories, emotions, or trauma that have been buried for years.
          If you don’t have much support right now, go gently. Take your time. There’s no rush.
          If possible, consider walking this path with a therapist, guide, or trusted support.
          You don’t have to do this alone — and I wouldn’t recommend it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sd-soft">
        <p><strong>A very real note for beginners:</strong><br>
          Sometimes you’ll feel worse before you feel better — not because you’re broken, but because you’ve stopped numbing.
          If you feel overwhelmed, step back. Choose safety. Do something small and steady (food, water, sleep, a shower, a short walk, a hot tea).
          Healing isn’t a race. <em>Healing unfolds at the speed of safety.</em>

      <p class="section-subtitle section-subtitle--left">
        Why feelings matter — and what we can actually do with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of us were taught that emotions are inconvenient. Something to “get over.” Something to hide.
        But emotions are not a design flaw. They’re information. They shape our choices, our relationships, and our self-respect.
      </p>

      <div class="sd-card">
        <p><strong>Here’s the simple truth:</strong></p>
        <ul class="sd-bullets">
          <li><strong>Emotions drive decisions.</strong> We think we’re rational — but feelings influence almost everything.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotions shape connection.</strong> Relationships rise and fall on emotional awareness and repair.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional intelligence is a skill.</strong> It can be learned: notice → name → understand → respond.</li>
          <li><strong>Regulation spreads.</strong> When we’re regulated, we treat people better. When we treat people better, life gets kinder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin:0.75rem 0 0;"><strong>Line worth keeping:</strong> “When we take care of our emotions, we take care of each other.”</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        One of the simplest emotional tools I’ve ever seen is the <strong>Mood Meter</strong> idea:
        it helps you locate what you’re feeling without judging it — and then choose a kind response.
      </p>

      <div class="sd-soft">
        <p><strong>The Mood Meter (simple version):</strong><br>
          You can locate your emotional state using two sliders:
          <strong>Energy</strong> (high ↔ low) and <strong>Pleasantness</strong> (pleasant ↔ unpleasant).
          This isn’t about “being positive.” It’s about being honest.
        </p>

                Safety isn’t pretending everything is fine. It’s your body learning: “I’m not in danger right now.”
                Sometimes safety is a locked door. Sometimes it’s saying no. Sometimes it’s a quiet home.
                Safety is the base layer that makes healing possible.
