      <p class="lead">
        This space began as a way to catch myself when life felt overwhelming — a steady reminder that I wasn’t broken,
        behind, or alone. Over time, I realised it could become that kind of companion for others too.

          <h3 class="about-step-title">Where You Might Be</h3>
          <p>
            Embracing Authenticity is for people who feel worn down by pressure, unsure of who they are anymore, or
            caught between old survival patterns and a quieter truth inside them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of us grew up believing that to be loved, we had to stay small, agreeable, or quiet. We adapted. We
            coped. We disappeared a little. After a while, that way of living stops working — but it’s hard to know what
            to do instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re here, you might be somewhere in that in-between: not where you were, not yet where you’re going.

          <h3 class="about-step-title">What This Space Offers</h3>
          <p>
            This isn’t a personal brand or a self-improvement program. It’s a quiet, steady corner of the internet where
            you can slow down, make sense of what you’re feeling, and remember that you’re not the only one who finds
            life confusing.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll find writing prompts, reflective pathways, and lived experience shared honestly — not to fix you, but
            to help you <strong>meet yourself where you are</strong>. To give shape to feelings that rarely find language.
            To remind you that healing can be slow and still meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it as a gentle orientation point: somewhere to come back to when everything feels foggy.
          </p>

          <p>
            This space sits comfortably alongside therapy but doesn’t try to replace it. Therapists might recommend it
            for the time between sessions. You might return here on days when you feel lost, ashamed, or simply need to
            be reminded that someone else has walked a similar road.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s for the in-between moments: between breakthroughs, between conversations, between who you were and who
            you’re becoming.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not a place where you have to be okay. It’s a place where you can be <strong>in progress</strong>.

          I’m Alex — counsellor-in-training, father, and someone who’s learning how to trust life again after years of
          feeling like I didn’t quite fit. This site started as a way to hold my own process more gently. Now, I’m
          offering it in case it can hold a part of yours too.

          You deserve room to breathe, reflect, and reconnect with the truth of who you are — and you are welcome here
          exactly as you are.
