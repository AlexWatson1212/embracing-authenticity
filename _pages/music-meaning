<p class="lead">
  Music carries emotion. Emotion carries truth.<br />
  This space helps you use the songs you already love to stay in gentle, honest contact with yourself — at a pace your body can hold.
</p>

<div class="breathe-card breathe-card--info">
  <strong>New here? Start small:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick any song that moves you.</li>
    <li>Place a hand on your chest or belly.</li>
    <li>Notice one thing you <em>feel</em> while it plays.</li>
    <li>Take one slow exhale when it ends.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You’re done. That’s enough for today.</p>

<h2>A Simple Way to Use This Page</h2>

<p>
  You don’t need to analyse lyrics or “do it right”. Think of it as a gentle arc:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Ground</strong> — arrive in your body</li>
  <li><strong>Choose a theme</strong> — pick the emotion that’s closest</li>
  <li><strong>Pick a song</strong> that fits (any genre, any decade)</li>
  <li><strong>Listen</strong> — notice what happens inside</li>
  <li><strong>Reflect &amp; close</strong> — one or two questions, then come back to the room</li>
</ol>

<p>Use as much or as little of this as you like.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Step&nbsp;1 — Ground (Before You Press Play)</h2>

<p>Choose one small grounding move:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hand on chest + belly — <strong>exhale longer than you inhale</strong></li>
  <li>Feel your <strong>feet</strong> against the floor</li>
  <li>Notice <strong>three sounds</strong> around you</li>
  <li>Slowly roll your shoulders down and back</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t have to calm everything — just enough to stay here with yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Step&nbsp;2 — Choose a Theme</h2>

<p>
  Which emotion feels <strong>closest</strong> right now? A whisper counts.
</p>

<ul class="emotion-grid">
  <li>
    <strong>Shame</strong><br />
    When you want to disappear or hide who you are.<br />
    <a href="#shame">Explore &rarr;</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fear</strong><br />
    When not knowing feels like danger.<br />
    <a href="#fear">Explore &rarr;</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Anger</strong><br />
    When something in you wants protection or change.<br />
    <a href="#anger">Explore &rarr;</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Grief</strong><br />
    When you’re carrying absence, endings, or what can’t be fixed.<br />
    <a href="#grief">Explore &rarr;</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Longing</strong><br />
    When you ache for connection, belonging, or being met.<br />
    <a href="#longing">Explore &rarr;</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Love &amp; Safety</strong><br />
    When something inside settles and softens.<br />
    <a href="#love-safety">Explore &rarr;</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Joy</strong><br />
    When life expands, even a little.<br />
    <a href="#joy">Explore &rarr;</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Boundaries / Self-Protection</strong><br />
    When “no” feels important but difficult.<br />
    <a href="#boundaries-self-protection">Explore &rarr;</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pick <strong>any song</strong> that fits your theme — even if you’re not sure why. Then move on.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Step&nbsp;3 — Listen</h2>

<p>While the song plays, gently notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where your body <strong>tightens</strong> or <strong>softens</strong></li>
  <li>what memories appear</li>
  <li>what you want to do (lean in, turn away, move, cry, go quiet)</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re not fixing anything. You’re just observing.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Step&nbsp;4 — Reflect (1–2 Questions Only)</h2>

<p>
  From the theme you chose, pick <strong>one</strong> reflection question (two at most).
  Let it land. See what appears — on the page, in your body, or just in your awareness.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Step&nbsp;5 — Close Gently</h2>

<p>When the song ends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name <strong>one</strong> thing you noticed.</li>
  <li>Put a hand on your heart or over your ribs.</li>
  <li>Take one slow, grounding exhale.</li>
  <li>Look around and find <strong>three</strong> steadying things in the room.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Enoughness is a pace.</em><br />You’re already meeting yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
