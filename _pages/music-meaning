<p class="lead">
Music carries emotion. Emotion carries truth.  
This space helps you use the songs you already love to stay in gentle, honest contact with yourself — at a pace your body can hold.

## The Full Rhythm (If You Want It)

This isn’t about analysing lyrics or solving anything.

Just follow this gentle arc:

1. **Ground** — arrive in your body  
2. **Choose a song** that stirs something  
3. **Listen** — notice, don’t judge  
4. **Reflect** — one or two questions only  
5. **Close** — reconnect with the room

No performance. No pressure.  
Just honest connection with yourself.

---

## Step 1 — Ground (Before You Press Play)

Choose one:

- Hand on chest + belly — **exhale longer than you inhale**  
- Feel your **feet** against the floor  
- Notice **three sounds** around you  
- Slowly roll your shoulders down and back

> You don’t have to calm everything.  
> Just enough to stay here with yourself.

---

## Step 2 — Choose a Theme

Which emotion feels **closest** right now?

A whisper counts.

<div class="emotion-grid">

- **Shame**  
  When you want to disappear or hide who you are  
  [Explore →](#shame)

- **Fear**  
  When uncertainty feels like danger  
  [Explore →](#fear)

- **Anger**  
  When something in you wants protection or change  
  [Explore →](#anger)

- **Grief**  
  When you’re carrying absence, endings, or what cannot be fixed  
  [Explore →](#grief)

- **Longing**  
  When you ache for connection, belonging, or being met  
  [Explore →](#longing)

- **Love & Safety**  
  When something inside settles and softens  
  [Explore →](#love--safety)

- **Joy**  
  When life expands, even a little  
  [Explore →](#joy)

- **Boundaries / Self-Protection**  
  When “no” feels important but difficult  
  [Explore →](#boundaries--self-protection)

</div>

Pick **any song** that fits. Even if you’re not sure why.

---

## Step 3 — Listen

While the song plays, gently notice:

- where your body **tightens** or **softens**  
- what memories come up  
- what you want to do (lean in, turn away, move, cry, go quiet)

Nothing needs to change. You’re observing.

---

## Step 4 — Reflect (1–2 questions)

Choose from the theme you picked.  
Let one question land and see what follows.

## Using This With Kids & Teens

You can adapt this page for children or teens you care about.

A few simple guidelines:

- **Keep it short.** One song, one feeling, one gentle question is plenty.  
- **Co-regulate first.** Sit together, breathe once or twice, and let them see you’re calm enough to hold whatever comes up.  
- **Use simple language.**  
  - “Did this song make you feel more sad, mad, scared, happy, or something else?”  
  - “Where do you feel that in your body?” (tummy, chest, throat, face, etc.)  
- **Normalise all feelings.**  
  - “It makes sense you feel that.”  
  - “Lots of people feel like that sometimes.”  
- **Offer choice.**  
  - “Do you want to talk more about it, draw it, or do something else now?”  

If things feel too big, gently pause:  
> “Let’s stop here for today. We can always come back to this song another time.”

<p class="small-note">
If anything here brings up big feelings, please bring it into therapy or a supportive relationship.  
You don’t have to make sense of everything alone.
