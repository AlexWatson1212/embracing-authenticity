Music carries emotion.  
Emotion carries truth.  
This page helps you follow both safely — gently — at the pace your body can hold.

## **How to Use This Space**

This isn’t about analysing lyrics or “figuring things out.”

It’s a simple rhythm:

1. **Ground** (arrive in your body)
2. **Choose a song** that stirs something
3. **Notice**, don’t judge
4. **Reflect** gently after

No performance.  
No pressure.  
Just honest contact with yourself.

---

## **Step 1 — Grounding (Before Listening)**

Choose one:

- Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly — **exhale longer than you inhale**
- Feel your **feet** against the floor
- Notice **three sounds** around you
- Slowly roll your shoulders down and back

> You don’t need to calm everything.  
> Just enough to stay here with yourself.

---

## **Step 2 — Choose a Theme**

Pick the emotion closest to your experience today.

Even a **whisper** of a feeling is enough.

- **Shame**

  [Explore →](#anger)

  When you’re carrying absence, endings, or what cannot be fixed  
  [Explore →](#grief)

- **Longing**  
  When you ache for connection, belonging, or being met  
  [Explore →](#longing)

- **Love & Safety**  
  When something inside settles and softens  
  [Explore →](#love--safety)

- **Joy**  
  When life expands, even a little  
  [Explore →](#joy)

- **Boundaries / Self-Protection**  
  When “no” feels important but difficult  
  [Explore →](#boundaries--self-protection)

</div>

## **Step 3 — Listen**

Choose **any song that makes you feel that theme**, even slightly.

Notice:

- where your body tightens  
- where it softens  
- what memories come  
- what you want to do (move away / lean in)

There is no right response.  
Only information.

---

## **Step 4 — Reflect (After Listening)**

Pick **1–2** questions.

You don’t need to answer them all.
