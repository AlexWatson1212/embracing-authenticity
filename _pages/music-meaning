## How to Use This Space

This isn’t about analysing lyrics or “figuring things out.”

Think of it as a simple rhythm you can return to:

1. **Ground** – arrive in your body  
2. **Choose a song** that stirs something  
3. **Listen** – notice, don’t judge  
4. **Reflect** – one or two questions only  
5. **Close** – come back to the room

No performance. No pressure.  
Just honest contact with yourself.

---

## Step 1 — Ground (Before You Press Play)

Choose one way to arrive in your body:

- Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly — **exhale longer than you inhale**  
- Feel your **feet** against the floor or ground  
- Notice **three sounds** around you  
- Slowly roll your shoulders down and back

> You don’t have to calm everything.  
> Just enough to stay here with yourself.

---

## Step 2 — Choose a Theme

Pick the emotion that feels **closest** to your experience today.  
A whisper is enough — you don’t need certainty.

<div class="emotion-grid">

- **Shame**  
  When you want to disappear or hide who you are  
  [Explore →](#shame)

- **Fear**  
  When uncertainty feels like danger  
  [Explore →](#fear)

- **Anger**  
  When something in you wants protection or change  
  [Explore →](#anger)

- **Grief**  
  When you’re carrying absence, endings, or what cannot be fixed  
  [Explore →](#grief)

- **Longing**  
  When you ache for connection, belonging, or being met  
  [Explore →](#longing)

- **Love & Safety**  
  When something inside settles and softens  
  [Explore →](#love--safety)

- **Joy**  
  When life expands, even a little  
  [Explore →](#joy)

- **Boundaries / Self-Protection**  
  When “no” feels important but difficult  
  [Explore →](#boundaries--self-protection)

</div>

Once you’ve chosen a theme, pick **any song** that seems to match it — even if you’re not sure why.

---

## Step 3 — Listen

Play your song once, maybe twice.

While it plays, gently notice:

- where your body **tightens**  
- where it **softens**  
- what images or memories appear  
- what you want to do (move away / lean in / cry / go quiet)

There is no right response.  
You’re just gathering information.

---

## Step 4 — Reflect (After Listening)

Pick **one or two** questions from the section that matches your theme below.  
You don’t need to answer everything. Let one question land, and see what comes.
