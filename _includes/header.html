      <p><strong>How to Use This Page:</strong><br>
      Music has a way of revealing what words can't. This space isn't about fixing yourself or overanalyzing—it’s about tuning in. Notice the songs you’re drawn to. What’s happening in your life when you reach for them? How do they feel in your body?</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      We're not trying to diagnose or dissect—just pay attention. Make a note of what tracks you keep going back to, then return later and reflect. What emotions are showing up in those songs? What might that say about your inner world?
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, this simple act of noticing can become a guide. It’s like training wheels for emotional awareness—helping you understand who you are and who you’re becoming.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below, you’ll find reflections on songs that hit something deep. Each entry stands alone but may help you learn to explore your own musical connections more honestly. You can search by emotion or keyword.
