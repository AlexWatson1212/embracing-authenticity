    They are the orientation I return to when life becomes unclear —<br />
    a way of standing that values steadiness, honesty, and self-respect<br />
    over performance, optimisation, or certainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taken together, they’re my working definition of what authenticity looks like in real life.

  <h2>1. What I Mean by Authenticity</h2>

  <p>
    Living authentically, as I understand it, isn’t about being raw, dramatic, or endlessly expressive.
    It’s about staying in honest relationship with yourself — including your limits, needs, values,
    and nervous system — and letting your choices reflect that relationship over time.

  <h2>2. Self-Trust & Inner Authority</h2>

  <p>
    Learning to trust your own perception, evaluation, and timing —
    without outsourcing worth, clarity, or direction to other people.

<section class="principles-section">
  <h2>3. Boundaries, Responsibility & Integrity</h2>

  <p>
    Holding boundaries without hardening,
    taking responsibility without self-blame,
    and carrying influence or power without losing yourself.

  <h2>4. Emotion & Regulation</h2>

  <p>
    Learning to feel deeply without collapsing,
    to recover from shame without disappearing,
    and to repair relationships without self-destruction.

  <h2>5. Uncertainty, Limits & Reality</h2>

  <p>
    Accepting that not everything will resolve cleanly,
    that life includes limits and loss,
    and that some chapters will never make full sense.

  <h2>6. Connection Without Self-Erasure</h2>

  <p>
    Learning how to be alone without becoming isolated,
    how to stay open without becoming naïve,
    and how to walk away when staying costs self-respect.
  </p>

<section class="principles-section">
  <h2>7. Desire Without Self-Betrayal</h2>

  <p>
    Learning to name what I want without justifying it, suppressing it, or turning it into responsibility.
    Allowing desire — for love, security, and ease — without believing that choosing myself means losing connection.
  </p>

  <ul>

<section class="principles-closing">
  <p>
    These principles are not a destination.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are a way of staying oriented
    when certainty falls away,
    when roles dissolve,
    and when the temptation to abandon yourself is strongest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adulthood, as I understand it,
    is not about having answers —
    but about remaining grounded, honest, and intact
    while living inside the questions.
