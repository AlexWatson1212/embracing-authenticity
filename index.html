<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>This space was created to document the journey of healing, fatherhood, and discovering what it means to live authentically.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Alex. I created this space to hold the truths I wish I’d heard when I felt most alone. I hope something here meets you where you are.</p>

<h2>Why I Built This</h2>
<p>For a long time, I was afraid to share this part of me — the part that sees deeply, feels fully, and wants to leave something meaningful behind. But over time, a quieter, clearer voice grew stronger — not from ego, but from truth.</p>

<p>This site isn’t about perfection, performance, or proving anything. It’s about presence. It’s a space I’ve built to leave something behind for my son, Victor — and for anyone who might need a reminder that they’re not alone. These are the words I’d want him to read if I wasn’t here to say them myself. And maybe, in offering them, they’ll help others find their way back to themselves too.</p>

  <em>“Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”</em>
