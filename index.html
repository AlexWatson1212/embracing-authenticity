  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>I’m Alex — counsellor-in-training, father, and writer exploring what it means to live gently in a fast world.</p>
  <p><em>Embracing Authenticity</em> began as my way of healing after years of masking. Now it’s a space for others wired this way too — people who feel deeply, think in spirals, and need permission to go slowly.</p>
  <p>If you’d like to understand what authenticity truly means to me, read

    <h2>The Neurodivergent Lens</h2>
    <p>We look at life through a different rhythm. Instead of pushing to be “normal,” we listen to the nervous system — and make room for authentic communication, sensory needs, and spacious pacing.</p>
    <ul class="nd-points">
      <li>Sensory overwhelm & emotional regulation</li>
      <li>Unmasking & kinder communication</li>
      <li>Slow living, rest, and meaning in the in-between</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Ethical Caution Section -->
<section class="why-built container" aria-label="Ethical note">
  <h2>This Isn’t Therapy. And That Matters.</h2>
  <p><strong>Therapy isn’t always available. But healing can’t always wait.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Embracing Authenticity</em> is for those in-between moments — while you wait for support, after sessions, or when you’re reconnecting with yourself. If you’re without support right now, please go gently.</p>
  <p>Some reflections may stir old wounds or strong emotions. That’s normal — and it can be a lot.</p>
  <p><strong>When possible, walk this journey with a qualified therapist or mental health professional.</strong> You deserve support. No one should have to hold this alone.</p>

<!-- Why I Built This -->
<section class="why-built container">
  <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
  <p>I didn’t build this to prove anything or teach you how to live. I built it to see myself honestly — and to offer that honesty to anyone who needs it.</p>
  <p>For years I hid parts of me to cope. This space documents what healing actually looks like — not linear progress, but a series of quiet reckonings.</p>
  <p>If anything here helps you feel less alone, that’s enough.</p>
