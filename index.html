  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This space was created to document the journey of healing, fatherhood, and discovering what it means to live authentically.</p>

  <p>Hi, I’m Alex. I created this space to hold the truths I wish I’d heard when I felt most alone. I hope something here meets you where you are.</p>

  <h2>This Isn’t Therapy. But It’s Something.</h2>
  <p><strong>Therapy isn’t always available. But healing can’t always wait.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Embracing Authenticity</em> is a space for those in-between moments — between support systems, between clarity and confusion, between who you were and who you’re becoming.</p>
  <p>This project doesn’t aim to replace therapy — it’s here to hold you while you wait for it, work alongside it, or continue after it ends. A bridge. A companion. A reminder that you’re not broken — just becoming.</p>
