<section class="hero">
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This space was created to document the journey of healing, fatherhood, and discovering what it means to live authentically.</p>

  <p>Hi, I’m Alex. I created this space to hold the truths I wish I’d heard when I felt most alone. I hope something here meets you where you are.</p>
</section>

<!-- Why Built Section -->
<section class="why-built">
  <h2>This Isn’t Therapy. But It’s Something.</h2>
  <p><strong>Therapy isn’t always available. But healing can’t always wait.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Embracing Authenticity</em> is a space for those in-between moments — between support systems, between clarity and confusion, between who you were and who you’re becoming.</p>
  <p>This project doesn’t aim to replace therapy — it’s here to hold you while you wait for it, work alongside it, or continue after it ends. A bridge. A companion. A reminder that you’re not broken — just becoming.</p>

  <p>It’s also a resource for those who don’t know where to begin — who feel a little lost, a little tired, or a little overwhelmed by all the noise out there. This site exists to offer one thing: a sense of quiet clarity. A sense that you’re not the only one who feels this way. And that maybe, just maybe, you’re already enough.</p>

<!-- Why I Built This -->
<section class="why-built">
  <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
  <p>I didn’t build this site to prove anything or teach anyone how to live.<br>
  I built it as a way of learning how to truly see myself.</p>

  <p>For most of my life, I’ve hidden parts of myself — out of shame, fear, or simply not knowing how to express them. This space is an attempt to stop hiding. To let what’s real speak. To document what healing actually looks like — not as a linear process, but as a series of quiet reckonings.</p>

  <p>If you’re reading this, you’re not just seeing a website. You’re seeing the parts of me I’ve never fully shown before. And in doing so, I hope it gives others permission to do the same — to be more honest with themselves, more gentle, more free.</p>
