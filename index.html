<!-- Welcome Section -->
<section class="hero container">
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>I’m Alex — counsellor-in-training, father, and writer exploring what it means to live gently in a fast world.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Embracing Authenticity</em> started as my own healing project: a place to process childhood wounds, masking,
    addiction to coping strategies, and the slow work of becoming more secure. Over time, it’s become something bigger:
    a resource for anyone who is tired of performing and wants to understand themselves more deeply.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site isn’t about becoming “perfect” or “fixed.” It’s about learning to live in a way that is:
    more honest, more regulated, and more rooted in who you actually are.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’d like to understand the heart behind all of this, you can read

  <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
  <p>
    Think of this place as a companion rather than a programme. You don’t have to “do it all.” Just choose what
    supports you right now.
  </p>

  <div class="grid gap-8">
    <div class="breathe-card">
      <h3>1. Self-Discovery Path</h3>
      <p>
        A gentle, structured path through survival roles, attachment patterns, and slowly becoming more yourself.
        Written so that a younger version of you (or your child) could follow along too.
      </p>

    <div class="breathe-card">
      <h3>2. Music & Meaning</h3>
      <p>
        A “music therapy” section where songs become mirrors — a way to understand your emotions, history,
        and inner child through the music you already love.

      <h3>3. Personal Reflections</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve written hundreds of honest entries about parenting, trauma, dating, therapy training, and healing.
        They’re not polished “advice pieces,” but real-time markers of what this work looks like in an actual life.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666;">
        You’ll see some of these reflections featured below. They’re here to help you feel less alone,
        not to tell you how you “should” feel.

    <h2>A Gentle Lens on Difference</h2>
    <p>
      Many people who find this site relate to being autistic, ADHD, highly sensitive, or simply “too much” or “too deep”
      for the environments they grew up in. You don’t need a diagnosis for any of this to apply to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of forcing yourself to be “normal,” we look at your nervous system, your history, and your patterns with
      curiosity. What if there’s nothing wrong with how you’re wired — only with how it’s been responded to?
    </p>
    <ul class="nd-points">
      <li>Understanding emotional overwhelm and shutdown</li>
      <li>Unmasking safely and at your own pace</li>
      <li>Finding slower, quieter ways of living that still feel meaningful</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Ethical Caution Section -->
<section class="why-built container" aria-label="Ethical note">
  <h2>This Isn’t Therapy. And That Matters.</h2>
  <p><strong>Therapy isn’t always available. But healing work doesn’t pause just because the system is slow.</strong></p>
  <p>
    <em>Embracing Authenticity</em> is designed as a companion: something you can use
    <strong>between sessions, while you’re on a waiting list, or alongside your own reflective work.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Some pieces go into painful territory — childhood wounds, shame, loneliness, and psychosis. It’s normal for this to
    stir things up. It can also feel like a lot to hold on your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>When you can, walk this journey with a qualified therapist or mental health professional.</strong>
    You deserve support. You don’t have to make sense of everything alone.
  </p>

<!-- Pause & Breathe Interlude -->
<section class="breathe">
  <div class="breathe-card" role="note" aria-label="Pause and breathe">
    <h3>Pause and Breathe</h3>
    <p>You don’t have to read everything today. Take a sip of tea. Notice your body. Come back when something in you says <em>yes</em>, not when you feel pressured to keep going.</p>
  </div>

<!-- Why I Built This -->
<section class="why-built container">
  <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
  <p>
    I didn’t build this to brand myself or prove I have it all figured out. I built it because for most of my life I felt
    unseen, misunderstood, and alone with feelings that were too big for the rooms I was in.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is a record of what healing actually looks like over years: setbacks, strong emotions, good days,
    difficult boundaries, slow progress, and small moments of real connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    If anything here helps you feel less alone, gives you language for what you’re feeling, or helps you ask for better
    support in therapy, then it’s doing what it was meant to do.
