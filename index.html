  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This space was created to document the journey of healing, fatherhood, and discovering what it means to live authentically.</p>

  <p>Hi, I’m Alex. I created this space to hold the truths I wish I’d heard when I felt most alone. I hope something here meets you where you are.</p>

  <h2>This Isn't Therapy. But It’s Something.</h2>
  <p><strong>Therapy isn’t always available. But healing can’t always wait.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Embracing Authenticity</em> is a space for those in-between moments — between support systems, between clarity and confusion, between who you were and who you're becoming.</p>
  <p>This project doesn’t aim to replace therapy — it’s here to hold you while you wait for it, work alongside it, or continue after it ends. A bridge. A companion. A reminder that you’re not broken — just becoming.</p>
  <p>Whether you're rebuilding from grief, questioning everything, or simply trying to feel more alive — this is your space. Stay as long as you need.</p>

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>For a long time, I was afraid to share this part of me — the part that sees deeply, feels fully, and wants to leave something meaningful behind. But over time, a quieter, clearer voice grew stronger — not from ego, but from truth.</p>

  <p>This site isn’t about perfection, performance, or proving anything. It’s about presence. It’s a space I’ve built to leave something behind for my son, Victor — and for anyone who might need a reminder that they’re not alone. These are the words I’d want him to read if I wasn’t here to say them myself. And maybe, in offering them, they’ll help others find their way back to themselves too.</p>
